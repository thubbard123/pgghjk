    <Definition
      Link="">A chunk of information about a particular subject. Topics are the most important part of a project. Everything else is contained within  topics (e.g., hyperlinks, text, pictures) or points toward topics (e.g., table of contents, index, browse sequences). The very reason end users open a Help system is to find information, a little direction. They find that help within individual topics.</Definition>

      <Term>Table of contents</Term>
    </Terms>
    <Definition
      Link="">A method that end users can use to find information easily in your output. A TOC in Flare works much like a TOC in a printed book. It provides an outline of contents in your Help system so that end users can easily and quickly navigate to the information they need. You create a table of contents (TOC), adding books, topic links, and links to external files in a structure that you think would be useful for the user. End users then browse through a TOC to find information. For print-based and EPUB output, you need to use the TOC Editor to create a TOC just as you would create one for online output. However, there is a fundamental difference. Performing this task for online output creates an actual TOC in the output, which people use to navigate from topic to topic. This is not the case for print-based output. Performing this task for print-based output lets you indicate which topics will be included in the output and in what order. In that sense, this TOC functions more as an outline for print-based output. Therefore, for print-based output, you can think of it as an "outline TOC." If you want to include a generated TOC in print-based output, you need to use a TOC proxy in a topic instead.</Definition>

    </Terms>
    <Definition
      Link="">A way to change the look and feel of content directly so that the changes are applied only to that specific content (as opposed to applying the changes throughout your project via the use of styles). Many easy-to-use tools are provided for editing and formatting topics directly in the XML Editor to give them the look and feel you want, without having to know XML at all. Simply open the topic that you want to format, and use the tool that suits your needs best. This direct approach to formatting topics (sometimes called "inline" formatting) can be very attractive because it is quick and easy. However, it is recommended that you use style classes instead of local formatting whenever possible. Although local formatting is very convenient in the short-term, using style classes is much more efficient and can save you a great deal of time in the long-term.</Definition>

    <Definition
      Link="">In Flare's XML Editor, the insertion point cursor knows when it is inside or outside of a tag. By default, the insertion point cursor in the XML Editor is a bracket. This bracket cursor faces right ([) or left (]), depending on whether it is inside a particular tag. For example, let's say you have written a sentence. At the end of the sentence you have typed the word "Close" in bold font, followed by a period in regular font. Now you want to add the word "button" immediately after the word "Close," but you do not want the word "button" to take on the bold font. You hover the cursor at the end of the word "Close." The bracket faces left (]), which tells you that if you were to begin typing at that location, the next text would also be bold. So you move the cursor slightly toward the right and the bracket cursor faces right ([), which tells you that the next text at this location would take on the regular font of the period. You click the mouse button and type the new text in regular font.</Definition>

For example, you might want to organize the end of your manual so that a generated glossary is included, followed by the endnotes, followed by a generated index. Or you might want these elements to be included in a different order. An Endnotes proxy allows you to do just this. It also lets you start the list of endnotes on a new page (rather than immediately following the last paragraph in a manual).</Definition>

    <Definition
      Link="">An output type is designed specifically for content developers who want to use Flare to author an Eclipse Help plug-in. A plug-in lets you extend the existing Help contents that come with the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (IDE). It  requires an additional installation of the latest Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and Java version. This output type is particularly useful when you want to create  dynamic, searchable content that integrates into your Eclipse environment as a platform plug-in.</Definition>

    <Definition
      Link="">A way to design your web-based output so that the display is adjusted automatically depending on the device. Therefore, on tablets and smart phones, users will see a condensed look  that is more appropriate for those devices, compared with larger monitors. You can get the same effect if you shrink your browser to a smaller size.</Definition>

    <Definition
      Link="">For PDF, XPS, and XHTML outputs, you can apply breaks to page layout frames, similar to the way you can apply page breaks to content such as headings or paragraphs. By applying frame breaks you can automatically move content to the next frame on the current page in a layout. If no more frames are available on the current page, a page break occurs instead. This feature can be especially useful when you want to make sure that heading text is the only content in a particular body frame.</Definition>

      <Term>Background build</Term>
    </Terms>
    <Definition
      Link="">A method of building output from the user interface, where the compilation process occurs behind the scenes via Madbuild (Flare's compilation engine). The primary benefit of this option (besides the fact that it is quick and easy) is that you can continue working in your project while you generate one or more targets behind the scenes. This background build method is the default, but you can manually enable or disable it using the Options dialog. This includes the ability to specify the maximum number of concurrent builds. When this background build feature is enabled, the Builds window pane is used to display and manage the targets being compiled.</Definition>

    <Definition
      Link="">In terms of source control, a commit allows you to add your local changes to the source control database. When working with Git, committing adds your changes to the local Git database; you can later push them to the remote repository. When working with Subversion, committing the file overwrites the old copy of the file in source control with the new one from your local machine.</Definition>

      <Term>Lock: source control</Term>
    </Terms>
    <Definition
      Link="">When you are working with a project bound to source control, you may want to lock the files you have modified. Locking a file does not prevent other users from modifying the file. However, no one else can commit a file that you have locked until you unlock the file. If your project is bound to Subversion, you can steal a lock from another user if you need to commit a locked file while they are working on it. Likewise, another user can steal a lock on a file you have locked.</Definition>

      <Term>Branch</Term>
    </Terms>
    <Definition
      Link="">When working with a source control project bound to Git, you can create branches. Branches create a new development area for a file that is separate from the original. You can use branches so multiple authors can work in individual authoring spaces, and or you can use them as a space to make major changes in your document without affecting the original (e.g., when documenting a new feature, rewriting large sections of a topic, or making layout changes). Even if others will not be working on a file, you can still create branches if you want to edit your file and then refer back to its previous versions.</Definition>

    </Terms>
    <Definition
      Link="">A media query is an alternative group of settings in a stylesheet. These settings are automatically used under certain conditions, such when a screen of a certain size is displaying the output. Media queries are able to do this because they are configured with specific criteria (e.g., maximum width of the screen, orientation, resolution). When the criteria are met, the style settings in the media query are used to display the output. You do not tell a Flare target to use a media query; it just happens automatically.</Definition>

And each page of your output can have only one element with a particular ID. For many authors, using an ID may not be important, but for others—such as those making use of Javascript—IDs can be very useful.</Definition>
