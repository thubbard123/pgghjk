                            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel"><MadCap:keyword term="JavaScript:condensing" />Condense JavaScript Files </span>You can condense any JavaScript files in your output. This causes all of the output's runtime scripts to be merged into one file and improves web server performance by causing there to be fewer requests when loading the output.</li>
                            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel"><MadCap:keyword term="Images:pre-loading" />Pre-load Images </span>You can pre-load your images that are not initially visible when output is opened. When those images are triggered to be displayed, they will appear faster since they were pre-loaded. This happens at the cost of the output taking slightly longer to initially open since it must download more content. On the other hand, disabling pre-loading images will cause the output to open faster. Instead they will have to be downloaded when they are triggered to be displayed.</li>

You must generate and publish all linked Help systems at the same time. Selecting this option may slow down the generation of the output, but it will significantly increase the speed with which the output loads for the end user.</p>

After you choose this option, select the number of bytes for each chunk. The chunk size affects the speed that a Help system loads for a user. Depending on the Internet connection, different results will be seen. The smaller the chunk size, the greater the number of chunks that will be sent. A large number of chunks may result in a slower speed, especially if you have many merged "sub-projects" and the index is being merged. Chunking may slow down the generation of your output somewhat, but it increases the speed that the output loads for end users. For best results, you should test the different chunk sizes.</p>

This will improve the search performance that your users experience.</li>

This results in faster searches. It also allows people to use asterisk wildcards when performing searches. For example, if you type <span class="TypedEntry">Mad*</span> in the Search field, <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> will list all topics with words that have "Mad" followed by any other letters (e.g., MadCap, Madagascar, madness, Madrid).</p>

Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages do not have spaces as word boundaries, so n-grams are used to separate the words. Smaller n-gram values produce smaller search database file sizes. They also lead to more search results, which may be less accurate. On the other hand, larger n-gram values produce larger search database file sizes. They also lead to fewer search results, which may be more accurate. The default size in this field is optimal for most situations.</li>
