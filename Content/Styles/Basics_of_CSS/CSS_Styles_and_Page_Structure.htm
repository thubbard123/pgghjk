        <p MadCap:conditions="">In order to truly understand CSS, you need to understand how different parts of an XML-based document relate to corresponding style elements.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">As the following image shows, HTML and XHTML documents have certain style elements, usually with opening and closing tags (e.g., &lt;HTML&gt; and &lt;/HTML&gt;).</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/page_structure_example.png" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li MadCap:conditions=""><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">&lt;HTML&gt; </span>This is the outermost style element, which represents the document as a whole. In the image the &lt;HTML&gt; tags are red, and the outside line of the box model to the right is also red.</li>
            <li MadCap:conditions=""><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">&lt;HEAD&gt; </span> Within the &lt;HTML&gt; tags are two major areas, controlled by the &lt;HEAD&gt; and &lt;BODY&gt; elements. The first of these (&lt;HEAD&gt;) is used for storing metadata for the document, such as the properties title or other information that is not actually seen by the end user. In the image the &lt;HEAD&gt; tags are purple. Within the &lt;HEAD&gt; tags, this image example has just one sub-element, the document title, which is held within the &lt;TITLE&gt; tags.</li>
            <li MadCap:conditions=""><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">&lt;BODY&gt; </span> The second major area within the &lt;HTML&gt; tags is the main body, which is indicated by the &lt;BODY&gt; tags. In the image the &lt;BODY&gt; tags are light blue. The &lt;BODY&gt; tags are the container that hold the various pieces of content that the end user sees in the output. Within the &lt;BODY&gt; tags, this image example has just three sub-elements, a document heading held within the &lt;H1&gt; tags, and two paragraphs held within two sets of &lt;P&gt; tags. There are many more kinds of tags and elements that can be added to the &lt;BODY&gt; section in addition to the three that you see in this example.</li>
