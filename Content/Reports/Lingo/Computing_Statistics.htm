            <MadCap:keyword term="Reports;Statistics" />Computing Statistics</h1>
        <p>You can compute statistics for your <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> project, displaying information about the translation work. This is a way to compare the project files against the translation memory database in order to see how much translation work has been completed and how much still needs to be done. This report can be useful if you are a translator and need to provide estimates to a client, or if you are an author who is using <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> to manage the translation process. You can also export your statistics to XML&#160;if you want to complete additional analysis of the project in an outside tool.</p>
