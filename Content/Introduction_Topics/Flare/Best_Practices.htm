            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>There are many ways to single-source content in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />, and at many different levels. One of the most powerful ways to take advantage of single-sourcing is to do so at the broadest level—across multiple projects. It's called "Global Project Linking."</p>
                <p>If you have multiple <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> projects, you may find that you use the same content or files in some of those projects. Maybe there are a number of identical topics that you add to each project. Perhaps you have created a stylesheet that you copy and reuse in each project. Rather than creating this information separately, or relying on copy-and-paste actions, you can save time and ensure consistency by maintaining that information in just one project. When you want to use a file in another project, you simply import it by using a project import file. This creates a link between the source project file and the imported file in the secondary project. In the future, when you need to make changes to the file, you do not need to do so in multiple places, but rather in just one place—in the source project. </p>
                <p>If you decide to take advantage of Global Project Linking, it is highly recommended that you use condition tags when doing so. By applying condition tags to your files (e.g., topics, images, stylesheets, page layouts), you can more easily control which files are imported into (or excluded from) a particular project. This is especially true if you elect to use the reimport feature, which automatically imports files that you specify when you generate targets.</p>

            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Creating an index is an extremely important part of developing a project. It is a task that is part science-part art, and it often involves virtually every topic in your project. Therefore, it can be one of the most time-intensive tasks in developing a project. There are ways, however, to make the process a little easier and quicker.</p>
                <p>For authors who insert index keywords all at once, <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> provides two features that can be quite useful ("Index Entry Mode" and "saved layouts"). These features help authors add index keywords more efficiently.</p>

With the Index Entry Mode, you do not need to move around the interface as much; you simply click in the topic where you want to insert an index keyword and start typing (without typing over your topic content).</li>
                            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel"><MadCap:keyword term="Windows:layouts" />Layouts </span><MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> lets you save different layouts of the interface. So you could have one layout saved for when you are creating topics and adding content, and another layout for when you are indexing. In your indexing layout, you probably would want to have the Index window pane open.</li>

                <p>When you are working on a topic in the XML Editor, it is a good idea to make sure the structure bars are turned on. There are two types of structure bars (tag bars and span bars). These bars can help keep your topics less cluttered as you edit them (e.g., you can see condition tags applied to content by looking at the bar rather than having the condition tag markers show up in the content itself). Also, many tasks can be completed much quicker by using these bars. For more information see <MadCap:xref href="../../Structure_Bars/About_Structure_Bars.htm">About Structure Bars</MadCap:xref>.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>When you format your topics to make them look the way you want, you can do so in a couple of different ways.</p>

                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">External Stylesheets (Recommended)</span> Using external stylesheets instead of local formatting helps you work faster, more efficiently, and with more consistency in your topics. If you need to make changes to the formatting in the future, you do not need to change the formatting in each topic (as you would with direct formatting). Instead, you only need to change the formatting properties for that style in the appropriate stylesheet. In , you can create and use stylesheets at the topic level, as well as at the table level.

                <p>Applying stylesheets at the topic level is attractive because you can associate different stylesheets with different topics, even associating multiple stylesheets with a topic. However, in most cases you will use a single stylesheet for an entire project or target. Therefore, it is usually better to use a master stylesheet at one of those levels. That way, you do not need to manually associate the stylesheet with a topic before using the styles in it.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>You can save a lot of time developing a project by viewing and testing topics as you work on them, as opposed to waiting until you build the final output. Although there are certain features that require you to build the entire output before testing them (e.g., table of contents, index, cross-references, browse sequences, Help control links), there are other features that you can test for individual topics by simply previewing the topic. This includes clicking drop-down or expanding text hotspots, viewing condition tags (included or excluded from the topic), and getting a sneak preview of how the topic will look in the output. If you take the time to view and test topics as you create them, it could save you time in the end.</p>
                <p>To preview and test a topic, simply open the topic and click <img src="../../Resources/Images/preview_topic_btn.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" /> in the local toolbar of the XML Editor. If you click the face of the button, the topic preview is shown based on the format specified in the primary target. If you click the down arrow, you can select any of the targets in your project from a menu. The topic preview is then displayed using the output format specified in that target. See <MadCap:xref href="../../Topics/More_About_Topics/Previewing_Topics.htm">Previewing Topics</MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="../../Output/More_About_Building_Final_Output/Testing_Output.htm">Testing Output</MadCap:xref>.</p>

                <p>You can create new topics in several different ways. With most methods, the topic is created and added to the Content Explorer. Then, if you want the topic to be included in the table of contents (TOC), you need to create an entry in the TOC and link it to the topic. However, you can perform both tasks at the same time from the TOC Editor.</p>

                            <li>Using this method lets you accomplish two tasks at once. It simply saves you time.</li>
                            <li>These two tasks seem to feed on one another. When you first start a new project, creating a TOC early on helps you determine specific topics that you want to include in your project. Conversely, thinking of new topics helps you determine the kind of structure you want for your TOC.</li>

                <p>If you send topics to reviewers from time to time, there are a couple of features that can help streamline the process. By associating status file tags with topics and using the File List window pane to select topics for review, you might find that the process is much quicker and easier.</p>
                <div class="example">
                    <p class="exampleHeadTextEmpty">Example</p>
                    <p>Let's say you created a status file tag set so that you can mark your topics with the following statuses, depending on where they are in your development cycle: In Progress, Ready for Review, Ready for Translation, and Complete. (For more information and steps see <MadCap:xref href="../../File_Tagging/About_File_Tagging.htm">About File Tagging</MadCap:xref>, <MadCap:xref href="../../File_Tagging/Adding_File_Tag_Sets.htm">Adding File Tag Sets</MadCap:xref>, and <MadCap:xref href="../../File_Tagging/Creating_File_Tags.htm">Creating File Tags</MadCap:xref>.)</p>
                    <p>As time goes by, you associate the different statuses with your topics. Some of the topics receive a status of "Ready for Review." (For more information and steps see <MadCap:xref href="../../File_Tagging/Associating_Tags_with_Files.htm">Associating Tags with Files</MadCap:xref>.)</p>
                    <p>You want to send topics to your reviewer, but only those topics with the status of "Ready for Review." There are different methods for doing this (e.g., opening the properties for each file to see its status). However, the best and easiest way to accomplish this sort of task is to do the following.</p>
                    <p MadCap:conditions="">First, open the <span class="Emphasis">Review</span> ribbon (or you can use the Review toolbar), unless it is already open.</p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="../../Resources/Images/best_practice_file_tags_review_example1.png" class="MaxWidth90Percent">
                        </img>
                    </p>
                    <p MadCap:conditions="">Next, select <span class="Emphasis">View&gt;File List</span> to open the File List window pane (see <MadCap:xref href="../../Interface/UI_Elements/File_List_Window.htm">File List Window Pane</MadCap:xref>). Notice that there are several columns with information about each file, and you can drag the divider to see more of the columns.</p>
                    <p MadCap:conditions="">
                        <img src="../../Resources/Images/best_practice_file_tags_review_example2.png" class="MaxWidth90Percent">
                        </img>
                    </p>
                    <p MadCap:conditions="">The column you are interested in is the one showing the status file tags for each topic. One way to see this column is to drag the column dividers to reduce the size of the other columns. However, there is a better way to accomplish this. You can click <img src="../../Resources/Images/show_hide_columns_btn.png" class="ReduceButtonSize"></img> in the local toolbar to move the column you want to see higher in the order, or you can hide other columns (see <MadCap:xref href="../../Interface/Customizing_the_Workspace/Customizing_Column_Information.htm">Customizing Column Information</MadCap:xref>). </p>
                    <p MadCap:conditions="">
                        <img src="../../Resources/Images/best_practice_file_tags_review_example4.png" class="MaxWidth90Percent">
                        </img>
                    </p>
                    <p MadCap:conditions="">After doing this, the File List window pane might look something like this:</p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="../../Resources/Images/best_practice_file_tags_review_example5.png" class="MaxWidth90Percent">
                        </img>
                    </p>
                    <p MadCap:conditions="">Now that you can see the status tags next to the name of each file, you can sort the list so that all of the tags with a status of "Ready for Review" are grouped together. To do this, click the column heading that holds the status tags.</p>
                    <p MadCap:conditions="">
                        <img src="../../Resources/Images/best_practice_file_tags_review_example6.png" class="MaxWidth90Percent">
                        </img>
                    </p>
                    <p MadCap:conditions="">Next, click the first file with the "Ready for Review" tag. Hold down your <span class="Emphasis">SHIFT</span> key and click the last file in that group. </p>
                    <p MadCap:conditions="">
                        <img src="../../Resources/Images/best_practice_file_tags_review_example7.png" class="MaxWidth90Percent">
                        </img>
                    </p>
                    <p>In the Review toolbar click <span class="Emphasis">Send for Review</span>. This opens the Send Files for Review Wizard, which automatically contains the files you selected. Then use the wizard as you normally would to send the topics to one or more individuals for review. (For more information and steps see <MadCap:xref href="../../Reviews_and_Contributions/Reviews/Sending_Files_for_Review.htm">Sending Topics for Review</MadCap:xref>.)</p>
