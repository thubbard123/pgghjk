                <p>Here are the primary ways to manage your project:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Migrating Projects </span>Many of us collaborate on Doc-To-Help projects using Team Authoring, TFS, or SharePoint, but sometimes we simply need to transfer a project to a coworker or a client. This is done by sending the entire project folder, but here are a few tips to make the transition easier. See <MadCap:xref href="../../../Projects_Starting/D2H/Migrating a Project.htm">Migrating a Project</MadCap:xref>.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Modular Projects </span>A modular project is necessary when you have a collection of several different output files (and would like to keep them that way) but would like them to appear to the end user as a single output system. See <MadCap:xref href="../../../Projects_Starting/D2H/Modular/About Modular Projects.htm">Creating a Modular Project</MadCap:xref>.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Project Properties and Settings </span>You can provide your project with various settings. See <MadCap:xref href="../../../Project_Settings/About Project Properties and Settings.htm">Project Properties and Settings</MadCap:xref>.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Reports </span>Doc-To-Help has several reports that will help you organize your work and keep track of topics and index elements. These reports can be viewed, saved, and printed for maximum flexibility. See <MadCap:xref href="../../../Reports/D2H/DocToHelp Reports.htm">Doc-To-Help Reports</MadCap:xref>.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">SharePoint </span>Doc-To-Helpâ€™s integration with Microsoft SharePoint makes it easy to collaborate with your team, as well as across your company. See <MadCap:xref href="../../../Sharepoint/D2H/About_SharePoint_Integration_D2H.htm">About SharePoint Integration</MadCap:xref>.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Team Authoring </span>Team authoring is a source control feature that makes it possible for multiple authors to work together on a single project. See <MadCap:xref href="../../../Team_Authoring/D2H/About Team Authoring.htm">Team Authoring</MadCap:xref>.</li>
