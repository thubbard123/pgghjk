        <h1>Adding Topics and Other Elements</h1>
        <p>As soon as you start a project, you can do any number of things with it. Technically, you could build the final output immediately. However, if it is a new project, building the output right away would not do your end users much good, since the output does not yet have any real substance. The project needs topics, content, cross-references, navigation, and all of the other elements necessary to help your end users.</p>
        <p>Some of these features can be used in online output as well as print-based output, some are for online output only, and some are for print output only. Topics are essential for any project, but otherwise you can pick and choose which of the following to include and which to leave out. Also, it is not necessary that you add these items and features in any particular order, although topics usually are created first.</p>
        <p>For more detailed information about each of these features—including examples—see the online Help or the appropriate PDF guide.</p>
