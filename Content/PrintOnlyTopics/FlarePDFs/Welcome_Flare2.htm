        <h1>Getting Started Video and Tutorial</h1>
        <p>In addition to this PDF guide, we also recommend the Getting Started Video and Getting Started Tutorial for new Flare users. Although there is certainly common information in all three of these resources, each one is also unique.</p>

        <p>You can access the video and tutorial from the Start Page in Flare.</p>

        <h1>Planning Your Project</h1>
        <p>Before you create a project in Flare, you should first take some time to decide exactly what you want to accomplish with your output. Here are some of the questions you might consider:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What kinds of output do you want to create? </li>
            <li>Do you need online output, print output, or both? </li>
            <li>How many different versions of online and print output do you need?
</li>
            <li>Does the output need to be up on a server or placed locally on the end users' computers?</li>
            <li>How will you name your files to keep things consistent and organized?</li>
            <li>
What kinds of reusable content will you need?
</li>
            <li>How do you want your output to look? Will someone provide you with a design, or will you use one of Flare's project templates, swapping out your company logo and colors?</li>
            <li>Will one author be working on the project or will multiple people be involved?
</li>
            <li>Do you need to use a source control system? Which one?</li>
            <li>Do you need to merge multiple project outputs together?</li>
            <li>Would it be useful to keep a few shared files (such as a stylesheet and some images) in a parent project and then synchronize them with child projects (Global Project Linking)?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You might not think of all of the questions you need to ask beforehand. There might be some issues that come to mind after you're already well into your project. And you certainly won't know how to accomplish everything you want to right away. As is the case with any powerful and flexible software application, you will become more familiar and comfortable with it over time and the more you use it. So don't expect to be an expert immediately. But the more planning and preparation you do ahead of time, the smoother your journey in Flare will be.</p>
        <p>Also, it's a good idea to create some test projects and play with Flare's different features. Once you feel more comfortable with the basic steps and features in Flare, as well as the workspace, go ahead and get started with your own project.</p>
        <h1>Key Concepts and Features</h1>
        <p>There are seemingly an endless number of things you can do in Flare. But you don't have to do all of them, or even most of them. Instead, you should begin by learning about the most important concepts and features. These ideas all tend to revolve around the idea of content reuse (or single-sourcing), which means that you can take the same content, reuse it, and produce multiple outputs from it.</p>
        <p>Here are some of the most important concepts and features in Flare:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Building Blocks—Content Reuse </span>
                <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Welcome/BuildingBlocksContentReuse1.flsnp" />
            </li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Topic-based Authoring </span>Topics are where you type your text and add other content. If you come from the world of print publishing, you’ll probably be tempted at first to create really long topics—such as one topic for each chapter or even one topic for an entire PDF manual. And while Flare lets you create very long topics and there may be cases where you need to do that, for the most part, you want your topics to be smaller, digestible chunks of content that you can reuse for different outputs.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Conditions </span>
                <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Welcome/WelcomeToFlareMostImportantConditions.flsnp" />
            </li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Styles </span>You can take advantage of cascading stylesheets (CSS files) and the rules around them to control the look of your output in one place. This helps to keep the content separate from its presentation, which is very important when it comes to single-sourcing. CSS isn’t a Flare idea. It’s an international standard for formatting web content, and it was developed by a group called the World Wide Web Consortium (or W3C). You can learn all about the W3C at <a href="http://w3.org/" target="_blank">w3.org</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once again, these are just a few of the more important concepts and features in Flare. For more information about each of these concepts features, as well as others, open the online Help and check out the "Key Features" topic. You can also download the <span class="EmphasisItalic">Key Features Guide</span>.</p>
