        <p>You can view any differences between an older backup file and the newer file in the project. Color coding makes it easy to see where differences occur. You can also switch between the tag view and WYSIWYG view, as well as ignore the case and whitespace. You can view differences for XML-based files, such as .htm topic files.</p>
