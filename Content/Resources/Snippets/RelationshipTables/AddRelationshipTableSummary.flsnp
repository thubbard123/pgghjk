        <p>The first step in using a relationship table is to add a new file to the Advanced folder in the Project Organizer. You can add as many relationship table files as you need. Depending on your project, you may need just one relationship table or many. For example, you might want to use Relationship Tables 1 and 2 when generating Target A, but you might want to use Relationship Table 3 when generating Target B.</p>
