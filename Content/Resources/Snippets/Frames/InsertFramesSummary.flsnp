        <p>You can insert a new frame into a movie. When you do this, the new frame is added immediately after the selected frame. If you use this feature, you are essentially creating a link to the image of the frame in front of it. This means that the image for the new frame will automatically be updated if the image of the frame in front of it changes. If you move the new frame to a different location, its image will be updated according to whatever frame now precedes it.</p>
