        <p>In a movie, a frame is displayed for a certain period of time. When you record a movie, the timing of frames is automatically added, so that one frame displays for a certain number of seconds before it disappears and the next frame appears. However, you can adjust how much time a given frame is displayed. You can change the timing for a frame in the Timeline window pane or in the Frame Properties window pane.</p>
