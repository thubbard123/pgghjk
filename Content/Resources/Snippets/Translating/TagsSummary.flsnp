        <p>Tags are shown for elements and formatting that <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> is not able to read. For example, you might see miscellaneous tags when you import a Word document. Also, Flare project elements such as bookmarks, variables, conditional text indicators, or index keywords are represented by tags. It is not important that you know the purpose of each tag. As the translator, your job is to make sure the same tags in the source segment are added to the target segment and placed next to the appropriate words.</p>
