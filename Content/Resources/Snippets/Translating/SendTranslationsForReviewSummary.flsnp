        <p>You can send translated content to individuals for review. For example, you might use this feature if you are an author who has received files back from a translator and you want to send them to a third party (who does not have access to Lingo) to ensure the translations are correct. When you use this feature, you can export translations as a <MadCap:keyword term="MadCap Contributor" />MadCap Contributor review package.</p>
