The exception to this is condition tags, which are <span class="EmphasisItalic">not</span> removed if they span the entire unit (this is because condition tags can affect translation status).</p>
            <p>Similarly, unflattened snippets, conrefs, and variables  will be removed from the Translation Editor if they span the entire translation unit (e.g., a snippet that makes up an entire segment).</p>
