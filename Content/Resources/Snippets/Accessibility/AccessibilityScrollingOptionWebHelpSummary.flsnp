        <p>The Section 508 standard states that "Documents shall be organized so they are readable without requiring an associated stylesheet." This means that some users need to view output with styles disabled in the browser. However, if styles are disabled, the frame containing the toolbar in WebHelp and WebHelp Plus output may not be fully visible, and no scroll bar is provided because it was explicitly set not to display. Therefore, in order to be in compliance with Section 508, you can use an option in a Standard skin in Flare to set scrolling values for the toolbar and navigation frames in WebHelp and WebHelp Plus output.</p>
