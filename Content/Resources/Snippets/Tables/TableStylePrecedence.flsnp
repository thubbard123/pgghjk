        <p>Because you can often control the look of a table in multiple ways—(1) local formatting tools, (2) local table properties, (3) a table stylesheet, or (4) a regular stylesheet—it's possible that you might encounter conflicting settings from time to time. When this happens, the settings closest to the content typically has precedence. So any explicit setting in the Table Properties dialog (or other local formatting) has precedence over both stylesheet options, and the table stylesheet setting has precedence over the regular stylesheet setting.</p>
