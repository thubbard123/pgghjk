        <p class="TableText">The Product Foldout 3-Fold project template contains two topics and two page layouts designed to create a product foldout with three panes.  It is ideal for brief product instructions. This template starts you out with two PDF targets, one with crop and registration marks and the other without.  You can add other kinds of targets if you like.</p>
