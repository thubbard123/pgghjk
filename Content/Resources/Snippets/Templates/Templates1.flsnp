        <p>In addition to Word's built-in styles and those you create, there are several styles created by Doc-To-Help that you will use because they let you create features not otherwise available in Word. You can easily identify these special styles because they all begin with the prefix C1 or C1H (e.g., C1 Section Collapsed, C1H Link Tag, C1H Popup).</p>
