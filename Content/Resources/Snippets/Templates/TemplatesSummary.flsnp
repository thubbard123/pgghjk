        <p>When you <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare">create a project and </MadCap:conditionalText>add content (e.g., <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Analyzer">report files, </MadCap:conditionalText>topics, snippets, stylesheets) or project-related elements (e.g., <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare">tables of contents, </MadCap:conditionalText>targets<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare">, skins</MadCap:conditionalText>)<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare"> to it</MadCap:conditionalText>, you can use templates. A template is simply an existing file or element of the same type that you are creating. By basing your addition on a template, you are giving yourself a head start because the template already contains some settings or formatting for you. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Analyzer">For example, when you choose a template for a report file, it might already have a name for the report, some types of data might already be selected (e.g., broken links, new style suggestions, used condition tags), and the report could have a pre-set design with borders and a special font. You could then make any changes to the report (if necessary) and generate it.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
