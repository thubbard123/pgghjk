        <p class="TableText">This template contains several starter topics and other files designed to produce documentation for company policies and procedures. Autonumbering has been used to automatically add incremented numbers to chapters, headings, and tables. This template has been designed to maximize single-sourcing capabilities, including condition tags, variables, and other features. This template starts you out with two PDF targets, one with crop and registration marks and the other without. You can add other kinds of targets if you like.</p>
