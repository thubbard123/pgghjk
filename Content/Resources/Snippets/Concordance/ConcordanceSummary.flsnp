        <p>Lingo lets you use a concordance to perform advanced searches in one or more translation memory (TM) databases. You can also search suggestions from machine translation (MT) providers. This means you can search for words you've already translated to maintain consistency. The concordance searches the TM and suggestions from MT; in contrast, the search filter in the Translation Editor looks only in the current file.</p>
