        <p>If you want to send your project to another location or person, you can package (zip) the project into a single file that is much smaller than the entire project in its normal state. The zipped project can then be easily unzipped by anyone who also uses <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />, retuning the project to its normal state so that it can be edited. Zipping a project is also a great way to create and store a backup of your project.</p>
