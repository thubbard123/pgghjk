        You can open a topic or snippet and use the top area of the Index window pane to insert index keywords and subkeywords into that file. The major benefit of this method is that it lets you place index markers at specific places in a topic or snippet, as opposed to the very beginning of the file. While this method allows you the most control, it takes more time than the other methods.
