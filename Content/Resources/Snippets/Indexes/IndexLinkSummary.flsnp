        <p>In addition to creating regular index entries that point to a specific place in your project, you can also create index links. An index link is an entry in a generated index that points to another entry. There are three kinds of index links—"See," "See Also," and <MadCap:keyword term="Indexes:index links;Indexes:sort as links;Sort as links" />"Sort As."</p>
