        <p>Use a "See Also" link if the term in question does exist as an index marker somewhere in the project. The idea is that, if a user looks for that term in the index, you want to point the person to a different term <i>in addition to</i> the one originally sought. You can create as many "See Also" links for a term as you like. </p>
