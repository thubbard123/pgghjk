        <p>There may be times that you want to create a custom sort order for your Flare index or glossary. You can do this by adding a "Sort As"&#160;term to the index or glossary term. Custom sort orders are especially important when translating a Flare project because terms in each translated language may have different spellings or pronunciations that are not automatically picked up by Flare. Because of this, you may need to specify how the index or glossary should sort a term, so the term is identified correctly when the Lingo project is exported back to Flare.</p>
