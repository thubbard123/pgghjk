    <body>Use a "Sort As" link if you want to sort an index keyword as something else.  This can be useful when a keyword begins with a symbol (e.g., place &lt;html&gt; in the "h" section, instead of at the top of the index) or if you are using character sets that should be sorted phonetically. "Sort As"&#160;links apply to both first-level terms and second-level terms (e.g., if you sort the first-level term "&lt;html&gt;" as "html,"&#160;the index will also sort the second-level term "code:&lt;html&gt;" as "code:html"). </body>
