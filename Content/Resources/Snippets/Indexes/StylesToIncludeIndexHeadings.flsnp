    <body>When you insert an Index proxy for print-based output, you can specify whether the generated index should include headings above the alphabetical groups of entries. The default setting is "True," meaning that index headings will be included. However, you can always override this setting at the spot where a particular Index proxy is inserted. If you want all index proxies to not include headings by default, you can edit the mc-index-headings property, setting it to "False." </body>
