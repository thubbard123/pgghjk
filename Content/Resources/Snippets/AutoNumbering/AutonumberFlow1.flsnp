        <p>If you have created autonumber formats that include volume, chapter, or section numbers (i.e., those using {chapnum}, {secnum}, and {volnum} commands), you need to specify how they will flow from one to another. You can determine whether to (a) start a particular volume, section, or chapter at a specific number; (b) use the same number as the previous instance; or (c) continue with the next number in the sequence. In addition, you can specify the type of number format (e.g., Roman, alpha, uppercase, lowercase, text) to use for volume, chapter, or section numbers. </p>
