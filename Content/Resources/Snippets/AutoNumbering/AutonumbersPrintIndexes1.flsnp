        <p>There are two basic methods for adding page autonumbers (i.e., page numbers that also include the chapter or volume autonumber) to print-based output—(1) by inserting variables into page layout frames or (2) by setting the autonumbers on the outline TOC entries where new "chapters" start. With the first method, the autonumbers are shown on your main content pages, but they are not included in a generated print index. With the second method, the autonumbers are shown both on your main content pages and in a generated index. You would use the first method if you want a quicker process and are not including a print index, but you would use the second method if you need the autonumbers to show up in an index.</p>
