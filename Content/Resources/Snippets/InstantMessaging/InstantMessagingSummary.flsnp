        <p>Flare has an instant messaging system built into its user interface. This is especially useful for source control tasks when you are working with a team of writers. However, you do not need to be working with source control in order to take advantage of this feature. You can send an instant message on any subject to any individual on your network who also has Flare installed.</p>
