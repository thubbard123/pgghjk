        <p>As far as navigation at the bottom of a slideshow is concerned, you have the option to use bullets or thumbnail images. Bullets are probably best when the order of the slideshow is important. Thumbnails are best when the order is not that important; they allow users to easily click and find the exact slide they want to see.</p>
