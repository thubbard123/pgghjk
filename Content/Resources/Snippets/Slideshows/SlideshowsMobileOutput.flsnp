        <p>If you intend your slideshow to be seen on mobile output, keep in mind the width of your content. For example, if you have a table containing a lot of content and columns, it may not look great in mobile output because it's wider than a typical mobile device screen. But content than is narrow enough to fit on the mobile device screen should look fine in a slideshow.</p>
