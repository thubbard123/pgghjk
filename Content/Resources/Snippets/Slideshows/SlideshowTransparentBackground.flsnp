        <p>One common style task associated with slideshows is to set a background color on them. By default, slideshows are designed to have transparent backgrounds, but you can use a color if you want. The background color can be applied to  the MadCap|Slide and MadCap|SlideShow styles. If you choose "default" as the value, the slideshow will have a transparent background.</p>
