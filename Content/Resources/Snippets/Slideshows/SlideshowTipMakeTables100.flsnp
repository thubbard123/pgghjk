        <p>When you set a slideshow to be "responsive" in the Edit Slideshow dialog, this means that content such as images and tables within that slideshow will adjust automatically when the slideshow is resized. If you plan to include tables in your slideshows and you also set the slideshow to be responsive, the tables need to be set with a width of 100% using the "AutoFit to Window" field in the Table Properties dialog. You can also right-click on a table structure bar and set the width from the Table Size submenu. This ensures that the table, as well as any content within it, is responsive when the slideshow is resized.</p>
