        <p>If you add captions to your slideshow, keep in mind that the longer the caption, the more it will intrude into the space where the slide content is shown. As a workaround, you can add extra space to the bottom of your content. Also, you might want to make sure the most important information in the slide is seen in the upper portion of the slide.</p>
