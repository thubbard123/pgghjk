        <p>It is a good idea to avoid really tall content in slideshows. Otherwise, content in other slides may look awkward if you do not have "Adaptive height" set. If you want to include images that are rather large, you can set those images to show as thumbnails so that they are not seen at their original size until the user clicks them.</p>
