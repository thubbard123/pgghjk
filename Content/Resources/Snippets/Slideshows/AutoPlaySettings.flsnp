        <p>By default, slideshows require end users to navigate through them manually by clicking navigation buttons or bullet/thumbnail controls. But you can use auto play settings if you want the slideshow to start and progress automatically. To do this, open the Edit Slideshow dialog. Select the <span class="Emphasis">Playback</span> tab, and change any of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Start automatically </span>Select this if you want the slideshow to begin immediately once it is opened. Otherwise, end users would click a "play" auto button, which you can add by selecting the "Play/Pause button" option.<ul class="SecondLevel"><li><span class="SetOffSecondLevel">Delay (ms) </span>If you want the initial slide to be delayed before beginning to play, enter a time value (in milliseconds) in this field (1000 milliseconds=1 second).</li></ul></li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Pause on hover </span>Select this if you want the slideshow to be paused when the end users overs the mouse cursor over it.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Play/Pause button </span>Select this if you want to add a play and pause button at the bottom of the slideshow. End users will be able to start and pause the slideshow at any point by clicking these controls.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Slide duration (ms) </span>Select the amount of time  (in milliseconds) the slide should display before moving on to the next one. The default setting is 4000 (i.e., 4 seconds).</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Direction </span>Select the direction you want the slideshow to progress during auto play. You can make the slideshow progress to the next slide (default setting) or to the previous slide.</li>
        </ul>
