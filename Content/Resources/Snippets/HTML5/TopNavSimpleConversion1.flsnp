        <p>In this lesson, we show how you can take an existing Flare project and add a few Top Navigation pieces to it. When you are finished, the existing project will have a look similar to that which is produced from Flare's Top Navigation Advanced template project. The biggest difference is that we are not attempting to create an elaborate Home page similar to the one found in the template. Also, while we are adding a context-sensitive menu, it is not as fancy as the one in the template. Instead of appearing on the side of topics, it displays at the bottom of each page with a simple design.</p>
