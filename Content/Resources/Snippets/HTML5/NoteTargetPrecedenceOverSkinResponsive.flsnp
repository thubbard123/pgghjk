However, this is not true if you <span class="EmphasisItalic">have not</span> yet made a change to the tablet or mobile breakpoint fields in the Target Editor, but you <span class="EmphasisItalic">have</span> made changes to them in the Skin Editor. In that case, the numbers from the changed Skin Editor will be used.</p>
