        <p>External resources can be virtually any local or network files that you have access to (e.g., images, PDF files, <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> project files). From the External Resources window pane, you can easily bring external files into a project (i.e., a copy of the file is added to your <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> project) and keep them synchronized with the source files through mappings.</p>
