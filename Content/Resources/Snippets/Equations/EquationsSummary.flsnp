        <p><MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> supports equations written in Mathematical Markup Language (MathML) and LaTeX. After you've created an equation, you can then copy and paste it into <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />'s editor. This gives you more flexibility to use the editor and format you want. Once you add an equation into your project, <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> uses MathJax to render it.</p>
