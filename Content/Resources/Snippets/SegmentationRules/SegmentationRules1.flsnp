        <p>If you want to control segment breaks automatically, you can create segmentation rules. <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> follows the format specified by Segmentation Rules eXchange (<MadCap:keyword term="SRX file" />SRX). Therefore, after you create segmentation rules, you can export them to an SRX file. You can also import SRX files that have been generated in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />. </p>
