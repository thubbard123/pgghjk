        <p>When creating segmentation rules, keep in mind that you may need to enter spaces (or you can enter <span class="TypedEntry">\s</span> if using a regular expression) where necessary (see examples below). Depending on the circumstance, a space may need to be added after the last word in the After column, or it may need to be added before the first word in the Before column. The reason for this is that content structures and languages are different. An expert knowledge of regular expressions may help to remove the guessing from this task.</p>
