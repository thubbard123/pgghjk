        <p>(Optional) If you have objects such as text boxes or images in your PowerPoint slides, the default action is to import them into <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> frames as objects; you can then edit these objects as you like. However, if you want to flatten all of those objects into each frame when they are imported, click <span class="Emphasis">Import Slides as Background Images</span>.</p>
