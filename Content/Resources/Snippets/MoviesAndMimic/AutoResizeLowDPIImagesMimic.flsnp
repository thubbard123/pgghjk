    <body>Starting with Mimic Version 8, images with a very low DPI are rendered more accurately in the Frame Editor and the PDF output, usually resulting in slightly larger and more blurry images (as is consistent with their lower DPI). Therefore, if you upgrade from an older version of Mimic, you might notice images that looked a certain size before now look larger and more blurry (because their true DPI is being rendered more precisely). The best solution, and a long-term one, is to replace your lower-DPI images with higher-DPI images to be used in print output (ideally as close to 300 DPI as possible). But you also have the option to revert back to previous version behavior. If you select this option, the newer, more precise resizing from newer versions of the software is used. If you do not select this option, the behavior of older versions is used.</body>
