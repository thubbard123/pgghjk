        <p>On the next page of the wizard each slide from the PowerPoint presentation is shown. This gives you a chance to include or exclude specific slides in the import. By default all slides have a check mark next to them. To exclude a slide from the import, click the check box next to it in order to remove the check mark. You can use the "Select All" or "Deselect All" to quickly add or remove check marks for all slides. In addition, the Show Images check box lets you see a visual representation of each slide.</p>
