        <p>Why would you want to use one method over the other? You might want to keep this option deselected if you want to do lots of editing in the <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> movie and need to be able to adjust the objects as needed. On the other hand, you might select the option if you are content to edit all of your objects beforehand in PowerPoint. When you import the slides as background images, you will usually end up with a higher quality image and the objects and text will appear just as they do in PowerPoint, but you won't be able to edit them further in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />.</p>
