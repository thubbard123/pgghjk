        <p>view a list of all files that are associated with file tags, but those file tags have not been defined. This might occur, for example, if you have associated a file tag with a topic and then later change the name of the tag or file tag set. The old tag or set name is still used for the topic. Therefore, a problem exists. From the Undefined File Tags window pane, you can open the file in question and fix the undefined tag. You can also quickly rename or remove multiple file tag occurrences in a single batch.</p>
