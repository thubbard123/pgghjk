    <body>If you are using a custom template that uses the old macro-enabled DOTM&#160;format (or if your import a Word document that uses a DOTM&#160;template), you may see two Doc-To-Help ribbons while authoring in Word. This occurs when you are working in a Word document based on a template that contains macros while you are simultaneously using the latest version of Doc-To-Help (which uses the Doc-To-Help Word add-in to open the Doc-To-Help ribbon). </body>
