        <p><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Display Title </span>This field allows for modification of a topic title with respect to searches without changing the actual topic title in the source document. Use this property to add qualifying text to like-named topics. For example, a search for "intro" may yield several topics named Introduction, but by modifying the Display Title, you can force results such as Introduction (Help Authoring) and Introduction (HTML), without adding the text in parentheses to the source documents. This is the equivalent of adding a&lt;Title&gt; in HTML.</p>
