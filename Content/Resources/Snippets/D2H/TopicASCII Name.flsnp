        <p><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">ASCII Name </span>Specifies the ASCII-only string used to identify the topic in situations where non-ASCII characters are not allowed. This property is important for authoring in languages that have non-ASCII alphabets, such as Cyrillic and Asian languages. In some instances, names generated by Doc-To-Help must be ASCII.
