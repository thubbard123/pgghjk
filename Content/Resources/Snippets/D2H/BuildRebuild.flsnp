            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Build </span>When you choose the Build button, Doc-To-Help recognizes all the source documents that have been edited since the last build and makes those changes in the output. This is the quickest way to build a project.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Rebuild </span>When you choose the Rebuild button, Doc-To-Help deletes all of the content in the output folder of your target, then builds everything from scratch (not just source documents). If you make any global changes to your project (e.g., changing project settings, creating variables, glossary entries), you should do a rebuild. A rebuild will always take longer than a build, especially on large projects. You should always do a rebuild before reviews and releases.</li>
