        <p>For graphics embedded within Word documents, "Scale in target" and "Scale in build" options are equivalent; the size of the picture is the same as it is displayed in Word. For linked graphics, the options "Scale in target" and "Scale in build" also produce pictures of the same size, the size it is displayed in Word. The only difference between them is that quality of scaling (resampling) can differ for some images. With the "Scale in build" option, Doc-To-Help is responsible for resampling the image, and with the "Scale in target" option that task is left to the browser that displays the online target. Choose whichever produces best results.</p>
