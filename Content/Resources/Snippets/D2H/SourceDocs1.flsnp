        <p>You can add multiple Microsoft® Word source documents to your project, and within those you can add many kinds of elements and objects. Some features (e.g., images, lists, tables) are built into Word and therefore always available, whether the document is part of a <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> project or not. </p>
