        <p>If you use Doc-To-Help to create specific kinds of documents, like policies &amp;&#160;procedures manuals or knowledge base articles, you might want to create custom templates for these documents rather than using Doc-To-Help's standard templates. Custom templates can be used every time you create a new document so writers do not need to cut-and-paste formatting or copy styles from template to template. You can also provide sample text to remind writers of the information that needs to go in each section.</p>
