        <p>This panel is almost identical to the Output window in the Doc-To-Help application<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineLive"> (see <MadCap:xref href="../../../Interface/UI_Elements/D2H/Output window.htm">Output Window</MadCap:xref>)</MadCap:conditionalText>. However, the Doc-To-Help Build panel features an additional local toolbar where you can select the target you want to build, and start and stop builds directly from the panel. This added functionality lets you spend more time working in Word and less time switching back and forth between Word and the Doc-To-Help application. </p>
        <p>When should you use Word and when should you use Doc-To-Help to build your target?&#160;Since the functionality is very similar, it is a matter of preference. However, we recommend that you use the Doc-To-Help Build panel in Word if you are actively editing your source documents, and you use the Doc-To-Help application if you are not working in Word and need to build a new version of a Help target. This will help you save time because you will not need to use both applications at once.</p>
