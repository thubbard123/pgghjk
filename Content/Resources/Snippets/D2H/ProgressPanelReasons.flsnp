    <body>When you build a target, if the Doc-To-Help Build panel is not open because you built the target from the Doc-To-Help application (i.e., the panel was never open in Word), or you closed the Doc-To-Help Build panel in Word before the build completed, the Doc-To-Help Progress panel will display.</body>
