        <p>When you open a document in Word, Doc-To-Help uses an add-in to determine what commands are necessary for the type of document you opened. Depending on what kind of document you opened, Doc-To-Help's Word add-in will open in one of three different modes. The Doc-To-Help ribbon adjusts dynamically based on your document type and you will only see the functionality applicable to the document you are working on.</p>
        <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="D2HGuides.D2HTouringWorkspaceGuide" />
        <p>The add-in will search for the document in Doc-To-Help projects and then open in one of the following modes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">No Features </span>This mode is used for templates; new, unsaved documents; and documents with an unsupported format. </li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Basic </span>This mode is used when the document is not included in any Doc-To-Help project, the add-in is disabled, or the add-in cannot find the Doc-To-Help project associated with the document. This mode is also used for final output.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Full </span>This mode is used for all documents included in a Doc-To-Help project.</li>
        </ul>
