        <p><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Suppress Empty Topics </span>If selected, omits empty topics (those with a title and no text) defined with this paragraph style or topic type from online output. These topics will still be included in the TOC. This check box can be selected for a Contents topic type that is commonly used for the top-level style, such as Heading 1. If this style usually contains no text, it may be preferable that these empty topics are not shown in the Help window when the user selects the corresponding book title in the TOC.</p>
