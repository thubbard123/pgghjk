            <p>Let's say you place a condition on a topic called "Review the User Interface" so that it is included only in a&#160;Manual target. When you build a NetHelp target, that topic is excluded from the output, and a red X is shown next to it in the Topics window.</p>

            <p>Then let's say you are working in a source document and you begin to insert a link. In the Link dialog, you can see that the Review the User Interface topic has been removed as a result of the most recent build. But you are still able to select this topic when linking to it, in anticipation of building the Manual target in the near future (where that topic will be included).</p>
