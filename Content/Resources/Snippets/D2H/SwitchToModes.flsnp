By default, the document is copied into the project folder; if you leave this recommended default setting, the Word add-in in the original document will still run in Basic mode, and the copied document now in your project will run in Full mode​. If you do not select to copy the document to the project folder (i.e., you leave the document in its original location), the add-in in the original document will switch to Full mode.</p>
            <p>If an existing document is removed from a project, the Word add-in automatically switches to Basic mode.</p>
