        <p>The Doc-To-Help Project panel is a convenient way to access many of Doc-To-Help's features without having to switch back and forth between Word and the Doc-To-Help application. In fact, you may be able to do most of your work in Word without needing to use the Doc-To-Help application at all, simply by using the features available in the Doc-To-Help Project panel. </p>
        <p>We recommend that you use the Doc-To-Help Project panel in Word if you are actively editing your source documents and need to do quick tasks, such as adding links to other project resources (e.g., topics, keywords, variables), switching between documents, or viewing the table of contents. You should use the Doc-To-Help application if you are doing project maintenance or setup (e.g., creating variables or keywords in bulk, creating target-specific tables of contents, associating topics with keywords). This will help you save time because you will not need to use both applications at once.</p>
