If the document you open in Word is associated with a Doc-To-Help project, and that project is not already open in Doc-To-Help, Doc-To-Help opens in hidden mode. When you close all of the source documents associated with a hidden project, the hidden project is also closed.</p>
            <p>When Doc-To-Help opens in hidden mode, it is like it is running in the background. You will have access to any Doc-To-Help functionality available in the Doc-To-Help Word add-in. You can open the Doc-To-Help application by selecting the <span class="Emphasis">Open Doc-To-Help</span> option on the Doc-To-Help ribbon.</p>
