    <body>If you have existing Word documents that have a lot of custom styles, you can copy all of those styles from your templates over to Doc-To-Help’s custom templates using Word’s Organizer. This is also very useful if you are creating new templates to use with Doc-To-Help and want to copy over styles from existing templates.</body>
