For example, let's say you have a topic at the root level of the Content Explorer and another topic that is in a folder you created. Suppose that each of these topics contains a link to a Windows Media file that is stored (by default) in the Resources/Multimedia folder in the Content Explorer. The file will work in the first topic but not in the second. The solution is to move either the topic or the multimedia file to fix the link. Therefore, you might decide to move the multimedia file into the folder where the topic is stored. Alternatively, you might move all topics that use multimedia into one folder. Then, you might place all multimedia files in that same folder or a subfolder within it.</p>
