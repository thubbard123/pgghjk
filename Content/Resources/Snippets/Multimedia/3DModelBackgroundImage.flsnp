By doing this, you will see picture of the model instead of the gray box that appears by default.</p>
            <p>These two images show the same 3D model side-by-side. The one on the left is set to Activate on Click, so it shows a default gray box when the page opens. The one on the right is also set to Activate on Click, but a background image has been set to shows how the model will look it is activated, so you do not see the default gray box.</p>
