        <p>If you are creating a batch file, save the Notepad file to any location you like on your computer. When you do this, type <span class="TypedEntry">.bat</span> as the extension at the end of the file name (e.g., MyBatchFile.bat). At any time you like, you can generate the output simply by double-clicking the batch file. You can also use a tool to schedule the batch file to run.</p>
