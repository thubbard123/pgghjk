    <body>Anytime you build a target, a build log is automatically created. By default it is stored at the root level of the output folder. However, in the Options dialog (<span class="Emphasis">File&gt;Options</span>) you can choose where your log file will be stored when you build a target. As an alternative to the default location, you can choose to place it in the Reports folder of the Project Organizer, or you can select a custom location.</body>
