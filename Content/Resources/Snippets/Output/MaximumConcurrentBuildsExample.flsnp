            <p>Let's say you have three targets in your project and you have the Maximum Concurrent Builds field set at 2.</p>
            <p>You generate Target 1, and then shortly after, you also generate Target 2. These targets compile simultaneously. </p>
            <p>Then you tell Flare to generate Target 3. But because your maximum number is 2, Target 3 is queued for the moment.</p>
            <p>Let's say Target 2 finishes building. At that point, Target 3 begins its build process while Target 1 also continues its generation.</p>
