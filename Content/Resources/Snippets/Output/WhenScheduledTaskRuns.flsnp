        <p>When a scheduled task runs, the command prompt window opens on your computer and minimizes while the batch runs. This window closes automatically when the batch process is finished. If any errors or warnings occur during the process, a report is automatically saved so you can review the messages. You can then open the error report file from the Reports folder in the Project Organizer.</p>
