        <p>After you have created a project, added and formatted content, and developed a target, you are ready to build and publish the final output. Of course, you can build the output at any point during the development process, but if you make additional changes to content, targets, or the look and feel, you will need to build the output again to make sure the changes are included in the files that you deliver to your end users.</p>
