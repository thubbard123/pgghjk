        <p>After you create a batch target in the <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> user interface, you can start that batch whenever you need to (i.e., tell it to start building and/or publishing the related targets). However, you also have the option of creating scheduled tasks. You might do this if you want your targets to be generated or published automatically overnight. Scheduled builds are created using the <MadCap:keyword term="Windows Task Scheduler" />Windows Task Scheduler. However, the user interface in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> makes it easier for you to create scheduled tasks without leaving the application. If you use this scheduling feature, you do not need to have <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> open at the time the batch runs.</p>
