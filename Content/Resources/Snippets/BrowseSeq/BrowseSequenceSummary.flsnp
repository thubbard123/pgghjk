        <p>A browse sequence is kind of like an alternative table of contents (TOC) for online output. For example, if you have several topics that you think end users should read in order, you can create a browse sequence. Another way to use a browse sequence is to create an alphabetical list of all of the topics. So readers can use your regular TOC for a structured method of navigation (with folders and subfolders), or they can use the browse sequence for a more flattened, alphabetical way to find topics.</p>
