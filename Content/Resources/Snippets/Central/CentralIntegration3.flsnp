        <p>Although MadCap Central is located in the cloud, it is integrated with MadCap Flare. This integration lets you store copies of your projects in Central, continue to work on them locally in Flare, and keep both sets of copies in sync. You can use Central to quickly publish output (and roll back when necessary) without the need to involve an IT department.</p>
