        <p>If you are creating Word or FrameMaker output with master pages (or if you want to use "section" autonumbers), you may want to complete this task. After you create a master page for print output and configure it as necessary, you need to associate the master page with the appropriate content. In many cases, you will probably want to associate multiple master pages with various entries in your outline TOC (so that different master pages can be used for different parts or "chapters" in a manual). Otherwise, you would associate a single master page with an entire target; in that case, the same page layout will be applied to all topics in that target. Whenever you associate a master page with a TOC entry, you must first create a section break in order to do so. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineLive,FlareGuides.FlarePrintedOutputGuide">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../Output/Printed_Output/More_About_Printed_Output/Specifying_Section_Breaks_and_Master_Pages_for_Printed_Output.htm">Specifying Section Breaks and Master Pages</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
