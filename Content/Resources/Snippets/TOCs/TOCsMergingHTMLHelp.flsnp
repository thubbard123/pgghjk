            <MadCap:keyword term="HTML Help" />Use this merging method if you are developing <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.HTMLHelp" /> (a CHM file) and you want to merge your output with another CHM file. This method is useful, for example, if another author is working on the external <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.HTMLHelp" /> project to which you are linking and you only have access to the other CHM file (not the project files).</p>
