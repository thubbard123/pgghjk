        <p>If you need to add a new TOC file, you can select <span class="Emphasis">Project&gt;New&gt;Table of Contents</span> (if using the ribbon view) or <span class="Emphasis">Project&gt;Add Table of Contents</span> (if using the menu view) and complete the options in the dialog. After they are added, TOC files are stored in the TOCs folder in the Project Organizer. When creating a new project, Flare sometimes provides you with an initial TOC, depending on the project template you use; therefore, you may not need to add one.</p>
