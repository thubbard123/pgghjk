        <p>Use this merging method if you are developing <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.DotNetHelp" /> and you want to merge the output files from your parent project with the <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.DotNetHelp" /> output files from an external project. This method is useful, for example, if another author is working on the external <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.DotNetHelp" /> project to which you are linking and you only have access to the output files (not the project files).</p>
