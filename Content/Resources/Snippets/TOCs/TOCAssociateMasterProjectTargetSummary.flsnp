        <p>In most situations, you will have one TOC that you use for a particular output (target). In that case, you simply associate the appropriate TOC with the target. If you have multiple TOCs that you want to include in the same project or output target, the TOC that you associate with the project or target serves as the "master" TOC. In your master TOC, you have the option of creating links to the other TOC that you want to include in the output. If you do not select a TOC, Flare will use the first one in the project (if there is more than one). If you have specified a master TOC at the project level and another at a target level, the TOC at the target will take precedence.</p>
