        <p>After you’ve added content and information (e.g., projects, tasks) to your license, you will probably want to add widgets to your Home and Project dashboards. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Snippets.Snippet22">Widgets are objects that let you see important information at a glance. </MadCap:conditionalText>For example, on your Home dashboard you might want to see widgets showing storage and usage, project bookmarks, build activity, and a task calendar. And on your project dashboards, you might want to see widgets showing project properties, live builds, and target build history.</p>
