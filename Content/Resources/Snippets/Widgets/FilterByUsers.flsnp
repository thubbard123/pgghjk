        <p>You manage a team of users. You currently have a Task Calendar widget on your dashboard for your team's tasks, but you want one for your own tasks. You decide to duplicate the widget.</p>

        <p>Then you use a filter on your new widget so it only shows your tasks. This lets you keep track of your tasks in the new widget, while also using the original Task Calendar widget to keep an eye on the tasks your team members are working on. </p>

        <p>Keeping the tasks in two different widgets makes it easier for you to see which tasks belong to you and which ones belong to your team.</p>
