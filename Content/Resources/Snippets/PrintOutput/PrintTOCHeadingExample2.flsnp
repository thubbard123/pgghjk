        <p>Notice that "NewTopic3" is indented to the third level in the print TOC (because that is its position in the outline TOC). The other topics are at the second level. The books ("Chapter 1" and "Chapter 2") are at the first level, but they are not linked to topics; therefore, they are not included in the output. </p>
