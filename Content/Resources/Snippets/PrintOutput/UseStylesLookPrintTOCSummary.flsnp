        <p>For TOCs in print-based output, you can use styles to adjust properties such as font family and size, <MadCap:keyword term="Tables of contents:indentation;Indent:tables of contents" />indentation, word spacing, spacing above/below, TOC width, page number alignment, and leader settings (e.g., the dots between the headings and the numbers). The headings in the print TOC will take on the settings that you specify. You can also modify the look of the entire container holding the generated TOC.</p>
