        <p>A Flare author might email you a contribution template for you to use when creating new documents. Contribution templates are simply files with certain settings already in place. They are a quick way to create and edit documents in a pre-set format that the author wants you to use. You can save a contribution template and then use it later whenever you need to create new documents to send to a Flare author. By saving the template file in a folder called "Documents\My Templates\Contributor" you can easily select it when you create a new document.</p>
