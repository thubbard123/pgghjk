        <p>For example, if your variable set is called "MyVariables" and you want to use a variable called "CompanyName," you would enter this as the name of the <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Snippets.Snippet1">TOC</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Snippets.Snippet2">browse sequence</MadCap:conditionalText> entry: mcvariable:MyVariables.CompanyName. But if you want the entry to display as "Contact My Company" (where "Contact" is simply text you add manually and "My Company" is the variable definition), you would enter this as the name of the <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Snippets.Snippet1">TOC</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Snippets.Snippet2">browse sequence</MadCap:conditionalText> entry: Contact <img src="../../Images/variable_syntax_example2.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" />.</p>
