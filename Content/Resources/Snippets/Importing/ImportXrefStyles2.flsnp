        <p>The style is added to the <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> Style column. When you are finished importing the documents and the new <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> project is loaded, the content that had been associated with the FrameMaker style in the FrameMaker document will now be associated with a new style that has the appearance of the style that you mapped it to.</p>
        <p>What happens if you do not map a style? In the case of cross-reference styles, they are automatically added as style classes under the MadCap|xref style. For example, let's say you import a style called "PageOnly" from your source document and do not map it to anything. In that case, it will be called "MadCap|xref.PageOnly" in the resulting project.</p>
