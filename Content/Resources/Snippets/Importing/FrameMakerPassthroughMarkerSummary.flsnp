        <p>A passthrough marker is a special marker that you can insert into your FrameMaker source content when you have information or code that you plan to import to Flare and want left alone (or "passed through," leaving it exactly as you have authored it, rather than processing it). A passthrough marker can be just about anything, as long as  supports it in the XHTML code.</p>
