        <p>You can specify how the marker content should be treated when the FrameMaker document is imported. The first option is that you can import the marker content as regular text (which is the default setting). The second option is that you can import the marker content as an XML fragment (e.g., the first part of a bold tag—&lt;b&gt;—but not the second part). The third option is that you can import the marker content as a complete XML tag. </p>
