        <p>You can apply audio to individual frames in a movie. This includes the ability to select built-in system sounds (such as applause or electronic beeping), recorded audio, or imported files (such as <MadCap:keyword term="MP3 file" />MP3 and <MadCap:keyword term="WAV file" />WAV files). For example, you might use this feature to play recorded narration in order to help explain an action on a frame.</p>
