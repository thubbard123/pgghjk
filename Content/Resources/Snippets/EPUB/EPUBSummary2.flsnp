        <p>EPUB is sort of a hybrid format. The output is designed to be viewed electronically; in that way, it is like an online format. On the other hand, its structure is like a book or manual; in that way, it is like a print-based format. In fact, you can follow many of the same steps for creating PDF output to produce EPUB output. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineLive">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../Output/Printed_Output/Creating_Printed_Output.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Creating Print-based Output</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
