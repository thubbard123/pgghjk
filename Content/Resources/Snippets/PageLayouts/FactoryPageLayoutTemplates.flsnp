        <p>Following are the factory page layout templates provided by <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />. Many of these layouts already contain multiple page types. And many of the pages already contain content or variables in header or footer frames (e.g., page numbers, Chapter Number variables, Heading variables).</p>
        <ul class="FirstLevel">

        <p>Why are some templates called "Resizable"? It's not because only those page layouts contain pages that can be resized. You can resize the pages in any of these templates. The difference is that the resizable templates contain frames that have been anchored to the edges. This means that those frames maintain the same distance from the edges of the page if you choose to resize the page. The frames in other templates are not yet anchored (but they can be), which means that those frames will not automatically be resized if you decide to enlarge or reduce the page. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineLive">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../Page_Layouts/Frames/Setting_Frame_Anchors.htm">Setting Frame Anchors</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
        <p>You can also create your own page layout templates, which can be used in the future when you create new page layouts. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../Templates/About_Templates.htm" MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineLive">About Templates</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Print">See the online Help for more information.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
