        <p>In each page layout, you need to decide how many pages you need and add them to the layout. The number of pages that you add depends on the differences that may occur on the various pages. For example, you might add a First Right page to be used only for the first page of the chapter. You also might add a Left page for even pages (e.g., 12, 14, 16, 18) and a Right page for odd pages (e.g., 11, 13, 15, 17). Each of those page types might display header or footer content differently. You also might want to add an Empty Left page to make sure that new chapters start on a right page. In the Page Layout Editor, only one page will be visible at any one time, but you can navigate to the other pages quickly by using the small squares to the right of the editor (one for each page in the page layout).</p>
