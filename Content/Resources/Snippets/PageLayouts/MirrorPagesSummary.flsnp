        <p>Use this method if you have already created and configured a page and want the new page to share the same settings, with the page setup "mirrored" (i.e., the left and right margin settings will be reversed). For example, if the left margin on the original page is 1.5 inches and the right margin is .75 inches, the mirrored page will have a left margin of .75 inches and a right margin of 1.5 inches. This feature is typically used if you plan to create a Left page (for even pages) and a Right page (for odd pages). Most of the time, you would want a greater margin on the side of the page closest to any binding (to compensate for the extra space consumed by the binding).</p>
