        <p>After determining the number of page layouts that are needed to produce the kind of output you want, you can add the page layout files to the project. The best course of action is usually to use the factory templates provided by <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> and edit them as necessary. Another approach is to make copies of finished page layouts. After you configure a page layout as needed (adding pages, frames, page size settings, content), you can copy that page layout to create the additional ones that you need. That way, much of the work may already be completed in the subsequent page layouts, with only some tweaking necessary.</p>
