        <p>After you create a page layout and configure its frames and settings as necessary, you need to associate the page layout with the appropriate content. In most cases, you will probably want to associate different page layouts with various entries in your outline TOC (so that different page layouts can be used for different parts or chapters in a manual)<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Snippets.Snippet5,General.OnlineLive">—see <MadCap:xref href="../../../Output/Printed_Output/More_About_Printed_Output/Specifying_Chapter_Breaks_for_Printed_Output.htm">Specifying Chapter Breaks and Page Layouts</MadCap:xref></MadCap:conditionalText>. Otherwise, you would associate a single "master" page layout with an entire target or project; in that case, the same page layout will be applied to all topics in that target or project. You can associate a page layout with an outline TOC entry with or without creating a chapter break at the same time.</p>
