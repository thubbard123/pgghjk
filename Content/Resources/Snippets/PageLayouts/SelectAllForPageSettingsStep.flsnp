    <body>(Optional) The current page in the layout is selected at the top in the Page field. You can use this field to select any of the other pages in the layout and your changes will be applied to that page. If you plan to make the same changes to all of the pages in the layout, select <span class="Emphasis">&lt;all&gt;</span> from this drop-down. That way, you only need to specify your settings one time for all of the pages.</body>
