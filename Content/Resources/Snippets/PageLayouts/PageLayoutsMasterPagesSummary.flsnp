        <p>You can use page layouts and master pages to configure pages for print output (e.g., page size, orientation, headers, footers, page numbers). Page layouts allow for easy configuration through the use of content frames, a snap-to grid, dragging and dropping, alignment features, and more. Although they are similar to master pages, page layouts are more flexible and easier to use. Master pages, however, will continue to be available in Flare for users who have implemented them into past projects; plus, master pages are still useful for online output. The general rule is that page layouts are best for <i>print-based output</i> (when possible), and master pages are best for automatically adding headers and footers in multiple topics for <i>online output</i>. Neither master pages nor page layouts are used in <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.EPUB" /> targets.</p>
