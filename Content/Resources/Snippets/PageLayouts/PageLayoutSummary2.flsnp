        <p>Like all other files in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />, a page layout is an XML file. It has an <MadCap:keyword term="FLPGL file" />.flpgl extension. The traditional location to store a page layout in the Content Explorer is in the Resources\PageLayouts folder. However, you can store it anywhere in the Content Explorer that you like. </p>
