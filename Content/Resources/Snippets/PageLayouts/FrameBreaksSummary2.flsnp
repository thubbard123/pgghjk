        <p>In a stylesheet, the following properties are used: frame-break-before, frame-break-after, frame-break-inside. These are not part of the W3C's CSS specification. Instead, they were created by MadCap Software specifically to support this functionality.</p>
        <p>By applying these style properties, you can automatically move content to the next frame on the current page in a layout. If no more frames are available on the current page, a page break occurs instead.</p>
        <p>This feature can be especially useful when you want to make sure that heading text is the only content in a particular body frame.</p>
