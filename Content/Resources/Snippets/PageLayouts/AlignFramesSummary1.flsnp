        <p>The Page Layout Editor contains various tools to help you easily keep your frames aligned with each other on a page. For example, after adding a decoration frame to a page, you might want to make sure that its left border is aligned with the left borders of the header and footer frames on the page. This feature is not available for body frames.</p>
