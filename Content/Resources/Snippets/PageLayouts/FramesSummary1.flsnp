    <body>
        <p>Each page in a layout can contain multiple frames, which are used to hold content (such as <MadCap:keyword term="Frames:page layouts;Page layouts:frames;Page numbers" />page numbers and chapter titles) and determine where that content is positioned. When you add a new page, make sure the page contains at least a body frame (unless that page is using one of the empty page types). By default, certain frames may already be included in a page, depending on the template you select when adding a page layout. Frames are typically displayed as large, clear rectangles or squares on a page.</p>
