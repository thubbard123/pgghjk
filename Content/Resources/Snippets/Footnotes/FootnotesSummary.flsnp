        <p>A footnote is a comment that is used to explain a specific area of the text.<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare"> It is used primarily for print-based output.</MadCap:conditionalText> Both the area in the text and the comment contain a number or symbol that ties the two together. A footnote comment is typically placed at the end of a page where the corresponding number or symbol is placed in the text. Otherwise, you can place a comment later in the manual, such as at the end of a document, chapter, section, or book; in this case, the comment is usually referred to as an endnote.</p>
