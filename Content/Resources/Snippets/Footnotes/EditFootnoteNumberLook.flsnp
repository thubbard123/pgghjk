        <p>You can change the look of the footnote numbers (both in-text and in-comment), by creating and modifying span style classes. Alternatively, you can use the MadCap|footnote style or a class of it to modify the look of both the in-text and in-comment footnote numbers. The difference is that the span style lets you change the look of one or the other, rather than both at the same time.</p>
