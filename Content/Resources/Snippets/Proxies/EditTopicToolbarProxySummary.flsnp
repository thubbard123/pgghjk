    <body>For HTML5 outputs, the Topic Toolbar proxy will use whatever settings are specified in a Topic Toolbar skin component (if you have added one to your project), overriding any buttons you may have selected directly in the proxy. If you have not associated a Topic Toolbar skin component with the proxy, Flare will just use the first one it finds in your project. However, for outputs using Standard and Mobile skins, the settings in the proxy take precedence over anything you may have set on the Toolbar tab in the Skin Editor.</body>
