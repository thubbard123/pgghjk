        <p>A proxy acts as a placeholder for auto-generated content or content that you have created elsewhere. When you build output, the content takes the place of that proxy. Proxies can be added to regular topics<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare">, as well as to master pages</MadCap:conditionalText>.<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare"> The difference is that a proxy added to a topic will display that information in the output only once (wherever the topic occurs), but if a proxy is added to a master page, the content will show up everywhere that the master page has been applied.</MadCap:conditionalText> Proxies are quite often used for print-based outputs, especially to create navigation-like elements, such as TOCs, indexes, and glossaries. However, proxies can be used in online output as well. They can be especially useful if you are creating HTML5 Top Navigation output, where the traditional tripane format is replaced by a more modern design that relies heavily on proxies.</p>
