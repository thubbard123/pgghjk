        <p>The Previous and Next buttons in HTML5  output using Top Navigation skins (or no skin) differ from those in other WebHelp and other output types (including HTML5 outputs using a Tripane skin). In WebHelp and other output types, the Previous and Next buttons navigate between topics in a browse sequence (if one is available); otherwise they navigate between topics in the table of contents.</p>
