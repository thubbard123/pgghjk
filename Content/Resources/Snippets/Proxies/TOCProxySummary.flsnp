        <p>If you want your <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare">print-based </MadCap:conditionalText>output to include a table of contents (TOC), you need to create a topic specifically for this purpose and insert a TOC proxy into it. By default the TOC for your <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare">print-based </MadCap:conditionalText>output by default is based on the h1 through h6 styles that you have applied to content in your topics. The generated TOC in the print output is NOT necessarily based on the structure of your <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare">"outline TOC"</MadCap:conditionalText>, but the <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare">outline TOC</MadCap:conditionalText> IS used to determine the content to be included in the <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare">print-based </MadCap:conditionalText>output. However, there is a switch on the Advanced tab in the Target Editor that lets you base the generated TOC on the structure of your <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare">outline TOC</MadCap:conditionalText>.</p>
