        <p>A Mini-TOC proxy allows you to generate a portion of your table of contents (TOC) or topic headings at a particular location in the output. A Mini-TOC proxy can be used for both online and print-based output. For online output, you can insert a Mini-TOC proxy into a master page or a topic. For print-based output formats, you can insert a Mini-TOC proxy into any topic where you want to generate a small TOC. For example, let's say you want the first page of each chapter in a manual to start out with a small TOC, showing the page numbers where subheadings occur within that chapter. In that case, you can insert a Mini-TOC proxy into each topic that you plan to use as the beginning of each chapter. If you insert the proxy into a master page, each topic using that master page will have a mini-TOC. If you insert the proxy into certain topics only, mini-TOCs will be generated only within those particular topics. </p>
