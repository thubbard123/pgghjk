        <p>A Menu proxy allows you to create a menu based on your TOC file, allowing users to navigate to other topics. This proxy can be especially useful if you are creating HTML5 Top Navigation output and you want a context-sensitive menu to display next to each topic. When you build the output, the proxy is replaced with the generated menu.</p>
