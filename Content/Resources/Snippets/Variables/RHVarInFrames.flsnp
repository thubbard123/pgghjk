    <body>If you want certain content to be inserted into a frame automatically (rather than typing the text manually), you can use a Running Head variable. For example, you might want to automatically include the first h1 heading of each chapter into the header for certain pages. By using a Running Head variable, you can use just one page layout for all of your chapters, rather than having to create a new page layout for each chapter.</body>
