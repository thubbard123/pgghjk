    <body>In addition to any type of regular content (e.g., text, images) and page numbers, you can also insert custom date/time variables into master pages. This allows you to display the date and time on each page of your output. These variables update as if they are part of the topic, so you do not need to add a variable to each individual topic in your output.</body>
