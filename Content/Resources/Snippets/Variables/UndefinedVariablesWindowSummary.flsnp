        <p>view a list of all files where you have variables inserted in the content, but those variables have not been defined. This might occur, for example, if you have inserted a variable in a topic and then later change the name of the variable or variable set. The old variable or set name is still used at the location where it was previously inserted in the topic; therefore, a problem exists. From the Undefined Variables window pane, you can open the topic in question and fix the undefined variable. You can also quickly rename or remove multiple variables in a single batch, add the undefined variable to the project, or map the undefined variable to an existing variable.</p>
