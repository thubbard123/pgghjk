        <p>Variables are used for brief, non-formatted pieces of content (such as the name of your company's product or your company's phone number) that you need to use in your project over and over. They're especially good for text that might change frequently, such as version numbers and dates. Variables are stored in variable sets, which can hold multiple variables. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare">Depending on the template you select when creating a project, <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> may provide you with an initial variable set, but you can add as many additional variable sets and variables as you like.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
