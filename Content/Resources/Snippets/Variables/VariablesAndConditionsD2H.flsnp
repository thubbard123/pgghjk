        <p>You can assign conditions to text variables, providing even more flexibility for their use. If you’d like, you can create a single variable, and assign multiple text values and conditions for it. This allows you to insert a variable once, and have different text be used in each of your conditions. See <MadCap:xref href="../../../Condition_Tags/D2H/About_Conditions_D2H.htm">About Conditions</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>Conditions can be especially useful if you have multiple targets and want version numbering to be incremented separately for each target. After creating multiple version variables, you can associate target conditions with each one. On the other hand, if you create only one version variable and use it in several targets, the version number will increment after each rebuild of any of those targets. For more information and examples, see <MadCap:xref href="../../../Variables/D2H/Creating_Text_Variables.htm">Creating Text Variables</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>Rich content variables can include text that has been conditioned.</p>
