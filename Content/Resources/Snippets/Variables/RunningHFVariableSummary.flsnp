        <p>A Running Head (or Running HF) variable is a special variable that you can insert into a header or footer in a page layout<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare"> or a print master page</MadCap:conditionalText>. It lets you display certain text in the header or footer automatically, based on the style associated with the variable. For example, Running Head variables are useful if you want to include the title of each chapter in a document in a header or footer without having to type them into multiple pages.</p>
