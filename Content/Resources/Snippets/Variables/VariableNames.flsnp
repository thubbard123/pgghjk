    <body>When you insert a variable into a topic, the variable is displayed with brackets surrounding it. The bracket shows the variable set name, the variable name, and the variable definition (as long as your markers are turned on and the set marker width allows it). You can adjust the marker width to see more or less of the variable information. You can also tell <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> to turn off the variable names so that you only see the variable definition. </body>
