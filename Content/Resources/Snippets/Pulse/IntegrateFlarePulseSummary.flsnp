        <p>To integrate the embedded discussion forms and other Pulse features with your Flare output, add a new community in Flare. This action automatically creates a new system in Pulse, allowing your web server to host, store, and serve the embedded discussion forms that appear below the topics in your Flare output. This system also gives you and your team members the ability to moderate and administer the Pulse features and content from the Pulse dashboard.</p>
