        <p>New Pulse communities will initially be set for moderation (i.e., requiring approval of new posts). If you have a community that does not have this option set, you can select it in the Pulse dashboard. Moderators will receive an email notification when there is a new post pending approval. You can then click the link to that topic and accept or reject the post.</p>
