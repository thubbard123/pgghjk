        <p>A refresh button is available in some Pulse reports, allowing you to update the data while the report is open. The button is available on reports that have a drop-down in the upper-right corner that lets you switch from one community to another. By clicking <span class="Emphasis">Refresh Data</span> instead of pressing F5, the report data updates for the selected community. If instead you press F5, the drop-down switches to the first community in the list.</p>
