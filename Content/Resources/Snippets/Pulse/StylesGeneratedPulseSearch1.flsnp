        <p>Sometimes your output may display content that is entirely auto-generated, rather than pulling content from one of your topics. This occurs when search results are displayed. It also occurs if your output is integrated with MadCap Pulse and a user clicks the Edit User Profile button, which then displays information on the Pulse home page, with no topic content shown.</p>
