        <p>Pulse is a documentation-centric social collaboration platform that enables you to connect, collaborate, and share knowledge with fellow authors, employees, and your end users.  It functions much like many of the social media websites on the Internet, except it revolves specifically around your online output. It also gives you the ability to view several types of reports about your project, including which topics are being seen the most and which search terms are not yielding any results.</p>
