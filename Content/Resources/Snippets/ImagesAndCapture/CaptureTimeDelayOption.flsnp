        <p>Lets you enable the time delay feature. With this feature, images are captured after the number of seconds that you specify. It is useful, for example, if you need to capture tooltips in a software application. Tooltips typically disappear when you press keys, so a time delayed capture allows you to avoid this problem. With time delay enabled, you can initiate a screen capture, and during the "countdown" you can hover your mouse over a button to display the tooltip. When the countdown finishes, the screen capture is taken.</p>
