        <p class="tip" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Tip: &lt;/b&gt;">For print-based output, you should try to use images with a high DPI (dots per inch) quality (300 is typically recommended). The higher the DPI for an image, the more it shrinks in the output, so you should try to obtain as large as an image as possible to begin with. If that doesn't work, a lower DPI (e.g., 250, 200, 150) may produce acceptable results in print output. By contrast, online output is usually displayed at 72 or 96 DPI, so a lower DPI image is okay for those outputs. To produce the best possible images for both online and print-based outputs, you might consider using different images for those outputs and applying conditions to them. Another option is to use single-sourcing features with MadCap Capture, which lets you accomplish the same thing with only one image for both online and print outputs.
