    <body>If you are creating a project containing images and need to generate output for both online and printed output, chances are good that you require different image settings (e.g., file format, color depth, resolution) for those outputs. In the past, the easiest way to accomplish this task was to create one set of images for the online output and another set for the printed output. However, there is another alternative. If you have both MadCap Flare and MadCap Capture installed, you can single-source your images, producing only one set of images for all outputs. You can specify that the online images should have one group of settings, while the printed images have another group of settings.</body>
