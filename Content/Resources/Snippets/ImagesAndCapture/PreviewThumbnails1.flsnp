        <p>In the XML Editor, when you are viewing a topic or snippet that contains a thumbnail image, you can right-click on that thumbnail and select <span class="Emphasis">Preview Image</span> from the context menu. This enlarges the thumbnail image within the editor so that you can more easily see it and read any callouts within it. You can then click on the full-size image to return it to a thumbnail.</p>
