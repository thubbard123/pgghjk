    <body>When you add an image in a skin (e.,g., your company logo), that image becomes embedded in the skin file using binary code. If you later replace that image, it remains embedded in the skin, even though it is no longer being used (i.e., it is unreferenced). When you click the field to select an image, you can still see the old image listed with others. This adds unnecessary size to your skin file. However, you can select an option on the General tab of the Skin Editor to automatically remove unreferenced images from the skin when you save the skin.</body>
