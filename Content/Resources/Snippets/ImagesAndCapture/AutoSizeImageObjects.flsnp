        <p>If you have inserted MadCap Capture images that contain objects with text, you can auto-size those objects automatically when the output is generated. This can be done by selecting an option in the Advanced tab of the Target Editor. The original image file and its associated properties (.props) file remain unchanged. Only the output image is affected.</p>
