        <p>You can easily create a report based on the information captured in Analyzer. When doing this, you can provide a name for the report and select the types of information that you want to include in it. Another option is to immediately print the report after it is generated. You can also design the look and feel of the report, and then compile it so that it displays the selected data in the format you provide.</p>
