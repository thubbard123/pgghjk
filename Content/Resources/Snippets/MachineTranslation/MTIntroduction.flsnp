        <p>Machine translation (MT)&#160;is translation of text by a computer or translation program, such as Google Translate. A great benefit of MT is that it allows translators to translate a large amount of content quickly using an automated translation system, and then make any necessary updates to the translation on a case-by-case basis (e.g., using a termbase to replace certain words, fixing translations that are not accurate in context). Then, the translator can add the target segments to an installed translation memory (TM), improving the speed for future translations as well.</p>
