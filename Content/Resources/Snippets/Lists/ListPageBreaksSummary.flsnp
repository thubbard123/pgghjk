        <p>You can apply a page or column break to lists or items within them. You might do this if you want a list to end with a particular item on one page and begin with another list item on the next page or column. For example, you could create a class of the li style and you could call it something like "PageBreakBefore" (li.PageBreakBefore). For most items in a list, you could use the parent li style, but if you want a page break to occur on a particular list item, you could apply your li.PageBreakBefore style to it. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare">This feature is used for print-based output.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
