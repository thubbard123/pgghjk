        <p>At this time, custom list formats are supported only in PDF, XHTML, and XPS outputs. After browsers begin to support the CSS3 marker element that makes custom list formats possible, this feature will automatically be supported in browser-based outputs as well. Until then, if you want to generate a browser-based output, you should use the standard method for creating lists instead.</p>
