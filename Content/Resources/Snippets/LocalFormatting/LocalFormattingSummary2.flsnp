        <p>Local formatting (sometimes called "inline" formatting) can be very attractive because it is quick and easy. However, it is recommended that you use styles instead of local formatting whenever possible. Although local formatting is very convenient in the short-term, using styles is much more efficient and can save you a great deal of time in the long-term.</p>
