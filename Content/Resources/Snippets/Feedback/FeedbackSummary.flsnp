    <body>Feedback is a live documentation reporting service that works in conjunction with Flare to provide <MadCap:keyword term="MadCap Feedback:Web 2.0;Web 2.0" MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare" />Web 2.0 community benefits for your online output—including integrated user comments and statistics such as search keywords used and topics visited. Most of these benefits are available not only for Web-based Help (e.g., <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.WebHelp" />, <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.HTML5" />, and <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.WebHelp Plus" />), but also for desktop Help (e.g., <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.HTMLHelp" /> and <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.DotNetHelp" />).</body>
