        <p>When your end users attempt to submit Feedback comments in your output for the first time, they must first register by completing the Create Feedback Service Profile dialog (unless you enable anonymous comments for your output via Feedback Explorer). In your <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> skin, you can customize that Create Feedback Service Profile dialog, including which fields end users must complete and the way it looks. Two fields are always required in the Create Feedback Service Profile dialogâ€”Username and Email. In addition to those fields, you can choose from several others to add, such as name, address, fax, department, and more.</p>
