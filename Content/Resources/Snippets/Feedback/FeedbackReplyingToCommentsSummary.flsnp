        <p>After you receive comments from users, you can reply to them. You can either obtain the individual's email address and send a private response, or you can reply to the user from the online output so that everyone in the community sees your response. When you reply in the output, you can do so in two different ways. The easy way is to reply from a notification email you receive. Otherwise, you need to navigate in the output to the correct topic and reply from there.</p>
