        <p>Translation memory (TM) metadata adds additional details to each translation in the TM to help you identify each segment. Some of this information is gathered from the project details you enter when you initially create the project (e.g., the client and domain), and some is gathered as you edit the TM&#160;segment (e.g., the time the segment was last modified and the user who last changed it). You can view the metadata for each segment, and you can filter the entire TM to only display segments that have specific metadata.</p>
