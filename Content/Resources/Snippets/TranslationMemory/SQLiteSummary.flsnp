        <p>This is a self-contained relational database system that is in the public domain. In <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />, SQLite is intended for local TM databases and termbases, not those that reside on an external server. SQLite is easier and faster, just not quite as robust as SQL Express.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">SQLite is automatically installed during the process of installing <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />. For more information about this database system, see <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/" target="_blank">www.sqlite.org</a>.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">By default, the location for SQLite databases is in Documents\Lingo Translation Memories on your computer. However, you can choose a different location if you like.</p>
