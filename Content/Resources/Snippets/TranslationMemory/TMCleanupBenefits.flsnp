        <p>TM cleanup is especially beneficial if you have a very large database. If you have made edits over time to your TM, it may have duplicate segments that you are unaware of. Also, if you have imported several TMX files into your TM, there may be outdated information that needs to be updated with new terminology or removed altogether. TM&#160;cleanup is an easy way for you to manage your database&#160;within Lingo.</p>
