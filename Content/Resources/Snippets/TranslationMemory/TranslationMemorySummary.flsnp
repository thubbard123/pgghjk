        <p>A translation memory (TM) system is a database that consists of content in a source language next to the translated content in one or more target languages. The great benefit of a TM system is that it remembers what you have already translated in previous projects and uses it to provide suggestions for future translation work. You can connect your Lingo project to one or more TM databases.</p>
