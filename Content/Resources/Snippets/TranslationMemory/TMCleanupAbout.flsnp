        <p>Translation memory (TM) cleanup allows you to use TM&#160;metadata to search within the database and locate specific segments, such as those created by a certain user or those pertaining to a specific client. Using this information, you can then clean up your TM&#160;using find and replace, or by deleting segments that match your search criteria. You can also use TM cleanup to remove duplicate segments in your TM.</p>
