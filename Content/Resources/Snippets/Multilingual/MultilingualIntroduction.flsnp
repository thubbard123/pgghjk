        <p>A multilingual project is a Lingo project that includes more than one target language. Lingo allows you to add as many languages as you like to your projects, and you can add or remove them at any time. A great benefit to multilingual projects is that you can add all the languages you need to translate to a single project. This makes it easier for a translator to translate content in multiple languages, and it makes it easier for a content developer to send files for translation or review.</p>
