        <p>You might have used master pages in earlier versions of Flare when creating Word or FrameMaker output, but then decide to use the newer page layouts instead. You can manually remove all links to master pages in your target and table of contents. However, another alternative is to automatically disable the use of master pages in your project. By using this feature, Flare will ignore all links to master pages when you generate the Word or FrameMaker target. It will instead use links that you provide to any page layouts.</p>
