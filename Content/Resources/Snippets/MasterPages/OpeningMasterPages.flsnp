    <body>The traditional location to store a master page in the Content Explorer is in the Resources\MasterPages folder. However, you can store it anywhere in the Content Explorer that you like. At any time, you can open a master page and make modifications to it. The master page displays in its own page of the XML Editor and remains accessible as you work. </body>
