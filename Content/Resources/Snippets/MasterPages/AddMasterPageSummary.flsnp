        <p>You can add as many master pages to a project as you want. A master page lets you apply consistent content to topics and is contained in a file with an <MadCap:keyword term="FLMSP file" />.flmsp extension. The traditional location to store a master page in the Content Explorer is in the Resources\MasterPages folder. However, you can store it anywhere in the Content Explorer that you like.</p>
