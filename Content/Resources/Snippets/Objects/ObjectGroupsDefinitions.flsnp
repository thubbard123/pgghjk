    <body>You can group multiple objects into a shape group, which then acts as a single object. You can ungroup the objects at any time. Shape groups do not show individual keyframes, effects (excluding shadows), and effect keyframes in the Timeline, Frame Editor, or in the output, but you can apply these things to the group. However, individual objects within the group retain keyframes, effects, and effect keyframes, and those things will once again become editable on each object once they are ungrouped.</body>
