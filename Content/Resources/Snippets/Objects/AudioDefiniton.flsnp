        <p>In addition to the ability to add audio to cursors, you can also add sounds as objects themselves. As with any other type of object, you can add as many audio objects as you want to a movie frame, and you can adjust the timing of each audio object in the Timeline window pane's Frame View option. The Timeline window pane is also the best way to determine if a frame contains an audio object, since there is no visual indication of this in the frame itself.</p>
