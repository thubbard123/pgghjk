    <body>Converts the cursor to Text Rectangle mode, which lets you create a square or rectangle shape with text by clicking in the image and dragging in any direction. When you release the cursor, default text is shown in a popup editor. You can replace the text with your own and click outside the area to see the finished shape. In addition, this mode adds a background to the box (as opposed to a transparent background), which makes it easier to see the text.</body>
