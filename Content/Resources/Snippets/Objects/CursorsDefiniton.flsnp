    <body>When you record a movie, bitmaps of cursors are added automatically to the frames, along with trajectories of their movements. By default, cursors are displayed in a lightly shaded oval shape. However, you can edit the appearance of the cursor shape (e.g., if you do not want the oval shape to be seen at all, you could specify that the shape should have no border or fill color). If you do not want to use the style of the default cursor, you can create your own look and set it as the default cursor style for recordings. In addition to adding cursors automatically during a recording, you can add a cursor manually to a frame. You can even set a trajectory for that cursor.</body>
