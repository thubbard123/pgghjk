    <body>If you want the line to contain multiple line segments (e.g., you might want a line that goes left and then up), click at each location where you want a new segment to begin and drag the mouse in the appropriate direction. When you want to signal the end of the line, double-click your mouse. A line is displayed (by default with an arrow at the end).</body>
