    <body>When you record a movie, Mimic can capture any typing actions that you perform on screen. This typing is animated in the movie output. In other words, each letter of the content is typed as the user watches it. When you record in Automatic mode, you can select whether to add typing box shapes when you perform typing actions. If you select this option, Mimic inserts a typing box object when you type during a recording session. If you disable this option and type during a recording session, the frame in question becomes a <MadCap:keyword term="Full-motion video"></MadCap:keyword>full-motion video (FMV) frame. Not only can animated text boxes be added automatically when you record movies, but you can also add them manually when you edit the movie. </body>
