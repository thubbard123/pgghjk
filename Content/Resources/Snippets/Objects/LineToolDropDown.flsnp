        <p>Opens a submenu, which lets you select one of the following types of lines: Polyline, Curved, Wave, Dashed, Zig Zag. This converts the cursor to Line mode. You can create a line with or without an arrow at the end (which you can change or remove by double-clicking the line and using the Line Properties dialog). After you select the type of line you want to create, you can click anywhere in the image to identify the starting point for the line. When you move the cursor, a line segment is drawn. If you click the left mouse button, it signifies the end of that line segment and the start of another line segment. When you move the cursor, another line segment is drawn. You can identify the end of the line by double-clicking. If you hold down the <span class="Emphasis">SHIFT</span>&#160;key when drawing a line, you can use the line tool to easily draw create straight lines and perfect angles.
