For example, if you have identical properties set for the styles "p.tip" and "p.note," they will be included in the window pane (because they are both based on the p style). However, if you have identical properties set for the styles "p.tip" and "h4.note," they will not be included in the window pane (because one is based on the p style, whereas the other is based on the h4 style).</p>
