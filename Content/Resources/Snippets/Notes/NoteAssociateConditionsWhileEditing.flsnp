Therefore, you can quickly send the file to a reviewer and that person will initially only see content with conditions that you have included. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineLive">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../Reviews_and_Contributions/Reviews/Sending_Files_for_Review.htm">Sending Files for Review</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
