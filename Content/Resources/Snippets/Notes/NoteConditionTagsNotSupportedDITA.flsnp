        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;"><span class="Emphasis"><MadCap:keyword term="DITA:conditions" /></span>Condition tags are not supported if you are generating a target using the DITA output type, in the sense that you cannot include or exclude condition tags for that DITA output. Therefore, when you open a DITA target, the options in the Conditional Text tab are disabled. However, DITA-specific condition tag attributes are preserved in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> when you import from DITA; the DITA attributes are converted to condition tag sets in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />. In fact, you can create custom condition tag sets in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> that can be useful when you generate DITA output from <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />. You simply need to make sure that the condition tag sets follow the established DITA naming conventions for those attributes: condition tag sets can be named "audience," "product," "platform," "props," and "otherprops." When you generate the output, the condition tag sets are converted to the appropriate DITA attributes.</p>
