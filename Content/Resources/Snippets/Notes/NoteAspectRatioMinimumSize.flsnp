        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">When resizing objects, you can ensure that the aspect ratio is maintained. For example, if you want certain objects to be resized so that they are at least 2 inches wide, you can make sure that the height of each object is adjusted accordingly so that it stays in proportion. To do this, you would set the minimum width at 2 inches. You would then leave the minimum height property unspecified. In the same way, if you were to specify a minimum height, you could maintain the aspect ratio by not setting the minimum width property.</p>
