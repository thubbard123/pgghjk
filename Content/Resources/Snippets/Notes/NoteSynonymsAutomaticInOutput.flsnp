        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">After you create synonyms, there is nothing else you need to do in order to make them available in the output. If you create synonyms in Flare, they are automatically applied at the project level, so all targets will incorporate those synonyms when you generate and publish the new Flare output. If you create the synonyms in Pulse or Feedback Explorer instead, the synonyms become immediately incorporated into the output (even if you do not republish your Flare target). Please note that if you are testing synonyms in Pulse or Feedback Explorer, you may need to refresh the interface to see the changes.</p>
