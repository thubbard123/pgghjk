        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">When it comes to associating page layouts with entries in an outline TOC, it is important to understand the meaning of the word "chapter" in the Properties dialog. In that dialog, a "chapter" is simply the designation for a new portion of content that will use a particular page layout. It does not mean a chapter in the traditional sense of a manual. For example, if you have a title page, a TOC, 10 chapters, and an index in your manual, each one of those might be considered a separate chapter as far as the dialog is concerned, because you are creating a chapter break with a particular page layout specified at each of those locations in the outline TOC. Therefore, although you only have 10 chapters in the traditional meaning of the word, you might have 13 chapters as far as the dialog is concerned (one for the title page, one for the TOC, one for each traditional chapter, and one for the index).</p>
