        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">When would you use a termbase, and when would you use TM? The two are related, but not the same thing. TM is used for quickly applying previously translated segments. Termbases are really an extra tool for making sure you are using the correct term in a translation (i.e., context). That's why termbases let you provide additional info about each term. Also, TM is necessary in order to use a termbase and apply its suggestions, but a termbase is not necessary in order to use TM.</p>
