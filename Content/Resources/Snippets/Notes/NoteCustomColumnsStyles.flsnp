        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">The three style classes mentioned above are designed to work in sync with the column headings in the Relationship Table Editor. You can change the column heading (i.e., link type) for any of these in the editor via the column properties dialog. You can also create a custom column. But if you do this, make sure that you create a corresponding style class in the stylesheet to control that column<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineLive"> (see <MadCap:xref href="../../../Styles/Creating_Selectors.htm">Creating New Style Classes</MadCap:xref>)</MadCap:conditionalText>. For example, if you create a custom column with a link type called "other," you should create a style class in the stylesheet named "MadCap|relationshipsHeading.other." If you do not create a unique style class for the custom column, it will use the settings from the parent MadCap|relationshipsHeading style. Therefore, the heading label will say "Related Information," instead of what you want it to say.</p>
