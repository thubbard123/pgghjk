        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">There is an order of precedence with the three levels where you can specify a page layout. Specific entries in an outline TOC have the highest precedence, followed by page layouts at the target level, followed by page layouts at the project level. So if you've got a page layout set at the project or target level and it doesn't seem to be working the way you think it should, you might check to see if you have any page layouts set on specific TOC entries that are overriding the target- or project-level setting.</p>
