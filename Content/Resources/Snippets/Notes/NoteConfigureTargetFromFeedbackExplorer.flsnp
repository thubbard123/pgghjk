        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">It is also possible to initiate the configuration of the Flare target (and create the necessary FBCONF file) from within Feedback Explorer. Although it is easiest to perform this task from within Flare, some individuals may want to do it from Feedback Explorer. For example, some people (such as managers) may not work in MadCap Flare, but want to track user activity in the author's online Help files. For more information see the online Help provided with Feedback Explorer.</p>
