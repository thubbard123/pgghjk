        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">If you send out review packages and then move or rename the project, you will receive an error stating that the package does not belong to the project when you attempt to import those review packages. That's because Flare looks for the path of the project. Therefore, in order for it to function correctly, you need to return the project to the original path and name.</p>
