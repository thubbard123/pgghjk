        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Some font families contain bold or italic variants (e.g., the font Georgia has a relative named "Georgia Bold" and another named "Georgia Italic"). If you are generating native <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.PDF" /> or <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.XPS" /> output, bold or italic formatting that is applied to text will display properly in the output ONLY if the font you are using already has a bold or italic font relative. You can determine the availability of such fonts by opening the Fonts folder from the Control Panel in Windows. For example, let's say you open the Fonts folder and see that, in addition to many other fonts, you have the following: Andalus, Angsana New, Angsana New Bold, Angsana New Bold Italic, and Angsana New Italic. If you use Andalus and apply bold or italic to some of the text, that content <span class="EmphasisItalic">will not</span> display in bold or italic in PDF or XPS output. However, if you use Angsana New and apply bold or italic to some of the text, that content <span class="EmphasisItalic">will</span> display in bold or italic in PDF or XPS output. The reason for this is that Andalus does not have a bold or italic relative, whereas the Angsana New font does.</p>
