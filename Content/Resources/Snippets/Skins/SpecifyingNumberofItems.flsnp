    <body>Because a mobile device is quite small, a user sometimes cannot see all of the information normally seen in one of the other online outputs. When a user opens a TOC, browse sequence, or index, it is not immediately apparent in mobile output how many items are associated with a particular entry. Therefore, <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> lets you specify that the number of items associated with each entry should be shown.</body>
