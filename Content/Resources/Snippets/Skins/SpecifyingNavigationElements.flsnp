    <body>You can determine which navigation elements from your project (TOC, Index, Search, Glossary, Browse Sequences, Favorites, Community) that you want users to have access to in the output. If you are creating <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.HTMLHelp" /> output, these elements will display as tabs in the output window (except for a glossary, which is included in the TOC as a book). If you are creating <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.DotNetHelp" />, <MadCap:snippetText src="../Output/WH_WHA_WHPOR.flsnp" />, these elements will display as accordion items in the output window. If you are creating <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.WebHelp Mobile" /> output, the elements will display as simple links. The Community option is for MadCap Pulse and therefore supported only in <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.WebHelp" /> and <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.HTML5" />.</body>
