        <p>When you edit a movie skin, you can export that skin to a location outside the movie or collection folder. If you accept the default location (in your Documents\My Templates\Mimic Skins folder), the skin file will automatically become available from your My Templates folder if you later try to import a skin. A skin file contains an <MadCap:keyword term="MISKN file" />.miskn extension. However, it is an <MadCap:keyword term="XML" />XML file, so it can be opened in any editor supporting XML.</p>
