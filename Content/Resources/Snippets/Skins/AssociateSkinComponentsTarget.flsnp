        <p>You are not limited to one skin component of each type, although that is the most common situation. If you want, you can use multiple skin components of any type. If this is the case, you can associate a "master" skin component with a target. When you do this, the skin component you choose will always be used for any proxy of that same type that you insert for that target, unless you override it by associating a different skin component with a specific proxy that you've inserted.</p>
