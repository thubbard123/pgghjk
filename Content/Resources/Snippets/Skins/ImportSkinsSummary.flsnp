        <p>If you have previously created and exported a MadCap Mimic movie skin, you can import it into another collection or movie. A skin file contains an <MadCap:keyword term="MISKN file" />.miskn extension. However, it is an <MadCap:keyword term="XML" />XML file, so it can be opened in any editor supporting XML.</p>
