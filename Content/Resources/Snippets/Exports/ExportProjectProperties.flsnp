        <p>If you have a master TOC, page layout, or stylesheet set in the Project Properties dialog and include those files in an export, the settings in the Project Properties dialog will be preserved. If you do not include those files in an export, default files are added to the exported project to allow it to work, and the settings in the Project Properties dialog are set to default.</p>
