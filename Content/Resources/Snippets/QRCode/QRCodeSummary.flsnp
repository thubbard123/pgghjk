        <p>You can insert a quick response (QR) code into a <MadCap:snippetText src="../Topics/ContentFileDocument.flsnp" /> using the XML Editor. A QR code is a type of barcode that can be read by devices such as smart phones. The data encoded in the QR code can be text, a website URL, an email address, contact information, or SMS (Short Message Service, which is used for sending text messages).
