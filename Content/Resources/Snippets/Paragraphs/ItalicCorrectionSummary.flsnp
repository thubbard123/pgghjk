        <p>You can correct the spacing in a line when italic formatting is involved. Often, when you italicize a word in the middle of a sentence, the last letter of the italicized word appears to have less space behind it. This is typically due to the fact that the blank space immediately after the word is italicized and the word that comes after is not. Using italic correction, you can increase this space between the italicized word and the non-italicized word.</p>
