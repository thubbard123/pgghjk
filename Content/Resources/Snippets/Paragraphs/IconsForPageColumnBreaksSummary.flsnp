        <p class="TableText">If you are working on a document in the Print Layout mode, you may see icons in the margins next to text. These icons indicate where a paragraph has been moved to another page or column as a result of a page or column break, or due to widow or orphan control. You can set page breaks, column breaks, orphan control, or widow control either manually on individual paragraphs or you can set them on styles. You can click on any of the icons in the document to open the paragraph properties.</p>
