        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Different browsers may treat margin and padding settings differently. For example, <MadCap:keyword term="Internet Explorer" />Internet Explorer 8 and <MadCap:keyword term="Firefox" />Firefox honor padding settings more than they honor margin settings. If you were to set a left margin at, say, 1 inch, Internet Explorer 7 would show it that way. However, in order to get the same results in Internet Explorer 8 or Firefox, you would also need to set the left padding at 1 inch.</p>
