            <p>Let's say that you have a paragraph containing seven lines. The first two lines of this paragraph are found at the bottom of page 11, and the final five lines are found at the beginning of page 12. If you want the two lines from page 11 to be pushed to page 12, so that all lines of that paragraph are on the same page, you can set the orphan number at 3. This means that there must be at least three lines at the bottom of the page. But because there are only two, those lines are forced to the next page. </p>
