        <p>By default, widow and orphan control is already enabled when you first install and launch <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />. When this feature is turned on, you can see the effects in the Print Layout mode in the XML Editor (as well as in the output). If you want to turn this feature off or on again, you can do so from the XML Editor.</p>
