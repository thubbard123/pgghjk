        <p>This depends on how you work in your company. Someone (perhaps a network administrator) needs to set up your source control program (such as Microsoft Team Foundation Server) and create the necessary database(s) in it. This individual may also set up the "rights" to all persons who have access to the necessary databases and files. If you are working on a multi-person team, each person on the team needs to have a local copy of the <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> project and will be responsible for checking in and checking out files as necessary.</p>
