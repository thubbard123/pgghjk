        <p>Disconnecting from source control is beneficial because it allows you to modify files when you would otherwise not have access to the source control system (e.g., you are out of the office with your laptop or you do not want to access source control over VPN). It also provides a fallback offline status in the event that the network is disconnected while you are working, so you are able to continue working on the files you have checked out until the network connection is restored.</p>
