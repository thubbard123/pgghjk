        <p>No. <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> does not use a proprietary source control system within the  application. Instead, <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> allows you to connect (or "bind") your project to an existing third-party source control application that is separate from <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />.                      </p>
