        <p>If you are using source control integration in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />, you can check for frequent status changes automatically. You can specify the number of minutes and seconds when you want <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> to ping the source control repository and get status changes for files that have been checked out, submitted, moved, deleted, etc. The upside of this feature is that you can ensure that the source control status information is always up to date. The downside is that you may experience slower performance due to this constant communication over the network.</p>
