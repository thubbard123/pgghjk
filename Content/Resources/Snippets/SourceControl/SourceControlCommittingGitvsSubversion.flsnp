    <body>If your project is bound to Git, committing a file adds your changes to the local database.  When you are ready to add your local commits to the remote repository, you can push these files to the remote. If your project is bound to Subversion, committing a file overwrites the old copy of the file in the source control database with the new one from your local machine. </body>
