    <body>If you want to push to, pull from, or synchronize using a branch you have created, you must publish the branch. You can still commit to an unpublished branch, but until you publish, you will not be able to send your commits to source control for backup. It is a good idea to publish branches unless you are only using a branch for a short period of time.</body>
