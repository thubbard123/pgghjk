        <p class="tip" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Tip: &lt;/b&gt;">If you are having difficulty binding your project, try binding to a brand new directory in your source control provider. You should also ensure that the directory on your local machine (and its parent directories)&#160;is not already mapped to source control, as this may cause issues with binding.</p>
