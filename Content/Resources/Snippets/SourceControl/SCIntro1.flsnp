        <p>Source control is a process that allows you to store your project files in a central location and determine which individuals have access to those files. By using a source control system to manage access to files, you can ensure that there are no file conflicts when many individuals are working on the same project (multi-user teams). You can also revert back to earlier versions of source control files if necessary. Source control is even useful for single users because it provides a means for maintaining a constant backup of all project files.                     </p>
