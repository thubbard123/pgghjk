        <p>This functionality scans your project when you load it to see if the project has been previously bound to source control. If a binding is detected, you then have the option of applying the binding and committing the project to source control. Depending on the provider you are using, <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> may search the file system and its artifacts, and contact and query servers, to find potential source control bindings.</p>
