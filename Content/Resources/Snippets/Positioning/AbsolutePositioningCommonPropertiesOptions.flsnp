        <p>When you have an element with absolute positioning, you can control its look and behavior as you normally would, using any number of available properties (e.g., border, font, background), depending on the type of element. However, you will find that there are a handful of properties and options that are related to and particularly important for absolute positioning, whether they are set on styles or locally.</p>
