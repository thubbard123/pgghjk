        <p>This tag lets you modify a footer row in a table. When a table requires multiple pages in print layouts and outputs, the footer row is placed at the bottom of the last page. Each &lt;tfoot&gt; tag must have at least one &lt;tr&gt; tag within it, which is used to represent a single row.</p>
