        <p>Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA) file content is supported in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />. DITA is an XML-based markup language with its own schema for authoring, producing, and delivering technical information. It is a standard of the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS), and it consists of a set of design principles for creating "information-typed" modules at a topic level and for using that content in various delivery modes.</p>
