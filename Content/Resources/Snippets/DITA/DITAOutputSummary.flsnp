        <p>In <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> you can generate output that produces DITA files. When you build this type of output, a DITA map file is generated, with multiple DITA files in it. The XHTML tags are converted to DITA elements. In other words, although it is considered an "output" from the standpoint of the <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> process, the end result is actually a collection of "source" files, which you can later use in another tool (or import back into <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />) to produce the final output.</p>
