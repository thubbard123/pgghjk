        <p>All <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> files are separate XML documents—topics, TOCs, browse sequences, page layouts, targets, skins, snippets, glossaries, destinations, condition tag sets, variable sets, and more. This means that <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> projects are completely open, transparent, and accessible. They can easily be used in other projects, shared with other authors, and modified with any XML editor.</p>
