        <p>A medium is an alternative group of settings in a stylesheet and can be very useful when you are generating multiple kinds of outputs. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare">Unless you tell Flare otherwise, default style settings will be used for the different outputs you generate. But there may be times when you want to override a default style setting for a particular output; that's why you would use a medium. <span class="EmphasisItalic">You need to explicitly tell Flare which medium you want a particular target to use.</span> This is done from the Advanced tab of the Stylesheet Editor.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
