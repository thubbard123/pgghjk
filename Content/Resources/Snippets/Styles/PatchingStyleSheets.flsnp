        <p>If you generate <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.HTMLHelp" /> output, some topics may not look as intended when they are printed from the CHM file, due to stylesheet-related problems. You can use this feature to "patch" those problems, ensuring the printed topics will look as intended. </p>
        <p>Why would you not use this option? The only reason not to use this option is when you plan to rename the generated CHM file. If this option is enabled and you rename the CHM file, styles in the output are broken. This happens because, when the option is enabled, the file name of the CHM is hardcoded into the CHM itself.</p>
