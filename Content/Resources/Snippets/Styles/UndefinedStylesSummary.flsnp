    <body>
        <p>view a list of all files where you have style classes applied to content, but those styles have not been defined. This might occur, for example, if you have created a new style class and applied it to a paragraph in a topic. Later, you remove that style class from the stylesheet. Therefore, you now have a style in a topic that is no longer defined in the stylesheet. You need to either apply a different, existing style class to that content, or you need to add the style class to the stylesheet again. You can also quickly rename or remove multiple style occurrences in a single batch, add the undefined style to the project, or map the undefined style to an existing style.</p>
