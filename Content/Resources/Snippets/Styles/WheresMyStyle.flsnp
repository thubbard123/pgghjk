        <p>When applying styles to content, you may notice from time to time that the style you are looking for is not available from the drop-down list or Styles window pane when you try to select it.</p>
        <p>This can occur if the style exists in a particular medium (e.g., print) but not in the default medium. So if you are working in the XML Editor with the medium set to default and you attempt to apply that style to content, you won't see it in the selection list with all of the other styles. To correct this, make sure the style exists in the default medium as well. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineLive">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../Styles/Creating_Selectors.htm">Creating Selectors</MadCap:xref>, <MadCap:xref href="../../../Styles/Mediums/About_Mediums_and_Media_Queries.htm">About Mediums and Media Queries</MadCap:xref>, and <MadCap:xref href="../../../Styles/Mediums/Selecting_Mediums_and_Media_Queries.htm">Selecting Mediums and Media Queries</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
        <p>Another possible reason for this has to do with the location of the cursor in the topic. <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> realizes where the cursor is placed and knows that only certain styles should be applied at that location.</p>
