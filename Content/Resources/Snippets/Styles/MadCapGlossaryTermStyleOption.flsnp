        <p>This is the primary style affecting the look of glossary term links. All of the other MadCap|glossaryTerm classes listed below inherit the settings that you apply to this style. If you want to change the font color or family, this is the style you would usually modify. If you want to change or remove the icon that displays next to glossary term links, use the Advanced view of the Stylesheet Editor instead.</p>
