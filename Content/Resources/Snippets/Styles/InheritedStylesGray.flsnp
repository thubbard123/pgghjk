        <p>When making changes to styles in the Advanced view of the Stylesheet Editor, you may notice that some styles are gray. These are called "inherited" styles. That's because they do not yet have explicit settings on them, so they are inheriting default values from somewhere else (e.g., a factory stylesheet located where you installed the application). As soon as you make a change to one of these styles, it ceases to be an inherited style (or at least the property you set is no longer inheriting from the default value), and the style name turns from gray to a darker font. You can click <span class="Emphasis">Hide Inherited</span> in the local toolbar if you want to hide these inherited styles.</p>
