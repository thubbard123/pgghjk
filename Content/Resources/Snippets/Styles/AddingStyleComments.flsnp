        <p>If you are familiar with using cascading stylesheets (CSS) in a text editor, you probably already know that you can add comments to styles. This is simply a way to remind you or others about information related to a style (e.g., which situations are appropriate to use a certain style). In <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> you can add, edit, and view these style comments through the user interface.</p>
