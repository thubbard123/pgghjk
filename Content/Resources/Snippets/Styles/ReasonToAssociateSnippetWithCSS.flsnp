    <body>Although it is possible to associate a stylesheet locally with a snippet, the only reason to do this is if you do not have any master stylesheets in your project. Without a master stylesheet, a snippet's content will look very plain when you open it. That's because Flare doesn't know which styles to use for it. In order to work in that snippet and apply styles to the content, you will need to associate the snippet with a stylesheet. </body>
