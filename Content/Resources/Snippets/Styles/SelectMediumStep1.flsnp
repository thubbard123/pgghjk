    <body>From the <span class="Emphasis">Medium</span> drop-down in the Stylesheet Editor, make sure the proper medium is selected  before you begin. In the Advanced view, you can open multiple mediums at once; you just need to look at the title at the top of the medium pane and make sure you are working in the correct one. If you are not using stylesheet mediums for your different outputs or if you want all mediums to have the same settings, just leave the medium set to default and continue.</body>
