        <p>A media query is an alternative group of settings in a stylesheet. These settings are automatically used under certain conditions, such as when a screen of a certain size is displaying the output.  Media queries are able to do this because they are configured with specific criteria (e.g., maximum width of the screen, orientation, resolution). When the criteria are met, the style settings in the media query are used to display the output. <span class="EmphasisItalic" MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare">You do not tell a Flare target to use a media query; it just happens automatically.</span></p>
