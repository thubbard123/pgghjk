        <p class="TableText">Hides the inherited styles from the list below in the editor. These are styles that do not yet have explicit settings on them, so they are inheriting default values from a stylesheet located elsewhere (e.g., a factory stylesheet stored in the place where you installed <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />). As soon as you make a change to one of these styles, it ceases to be an inherited style (or at least the property you set is no longer inheriting from the default value). In the Advanced view of the Stylesheet Editor, inherited styles are gray; non-inherited styles are black. In addition, there are a couple of factory media queries (tablet and mobile), which are inherited. If you have not yet edited these media queries, they will not show up in the Medium drop-down field in the local toolbar if you have this option set to hide inherited.</p>
