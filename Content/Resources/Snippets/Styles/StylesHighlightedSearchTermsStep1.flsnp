        <p>If you have an older stylesheet that does not yet contain the appropriate span classes you need for search highlighting, you can create them. You can do this for a main "SearchHighlight" class, as well as for the first 10 terms that users enter in the search field, naming each class "span.SearchHighlight1," "span.SearchHighlight2," and so on until you create "span.SearchHighlight10." The easiest way to create these classes is to import them from a Flare factory stylesheet, but you can also create them manually.</p>
