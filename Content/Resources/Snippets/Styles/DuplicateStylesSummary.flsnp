        <p>view a list of all styles in your project where the same properties have been set. For example, let's say you have a style called "p.tip" and another style called "p.note." If you have specified the same settings for each of these styles (e.g., red font, 12 pt), with no other properties set, these styles will be included in the Duplicate Styles window pane. Groups or pairs of duplicate styles are displayed in alternating shaded rows (e.g., the rows for the first pair of duplicate styles are not shaded, the rows for the next group are shaded, the rows for the next group are not shaded, and so on). If you encounter duplicate styles, you may want to modify the settings for one or both styles, or you can remove one of the style classes from the stylesheet.</p>
