    <body>A regular stylesheet allows you to single-source formatting by setting the properties in one place and reusing them throughout your project. But what if you want your online output to look one way and your printed output to look another way? Rather than creating a style for online output and another style for printed output, you can use a single style and provide it with two sets of properties—one set to use for online output and another set to use with printed output. You can accomplish this through the use of a medium in your stylesheet.</body>
