        <p MadCap:conditions="">Identifiers (IDs) are similar to classes, except that IDs are unique. An element in your stylesheet can have only one ID on it, whereas it can have multiple classes. And each page of your output can have only one element with a particular ID. For many authors, using an ID may not be important, but for others—such as those making use of Javascript—IDs can be very useful.</p>
