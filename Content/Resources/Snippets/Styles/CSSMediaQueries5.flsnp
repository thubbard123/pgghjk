        <p>You can place any valid CSS style settings in a media query, just as you can in a medium. For example, if you want paragraph text to suddenly turn blue when a topic is viewed on an iPhone, you can edit the mobile media query, telling it to use a blue font for all paragraph styles.</p>
        <p>One of the most common reasons to use a media query is to account for how the structure of content needs to shift or change when viewed on screens of different sizes. You can use Flare's Responsive Layout window pane to do exactly that.<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Snippets.Snippet2,General.OnlineLive"> See <MadCap:xref href="../../../Responsive_Web_Design/Creating_Responsive_Layouts.htm">Creating Responsive Layouts</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
