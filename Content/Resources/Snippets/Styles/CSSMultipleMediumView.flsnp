        <p>If you are working in the Advanced View of the Stylesheet Editor, you can open and edit multiple mediums at same time. You can do this by clicking the <span class="Emphasis">Medium</span> drop-down field in the local toolbar and choosing the mediums you want to see so that they have a check mark next to them. Media queries are also listed in the drop-down and can be opened at the same time as well.<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineLive,Snippets.Snippet1"> See <MadCap:xref href="../../../Styles/Mediums/About_Mediums_and_Media_Queries.htm">About Mediums and Media Queries</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
