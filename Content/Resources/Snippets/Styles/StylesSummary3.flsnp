        <p>The bottom line is that you want to avoid the opposite of styles as much as possible. That's called "local formatting." For example, you can highlight some text and make it green and italic right where that content exists. But if you do that same thing in many places, it takes a lot longer and it's a lot more work to control the look of that content if you later change your mind. Instead, it's much smarter and better to use a style.</p>
