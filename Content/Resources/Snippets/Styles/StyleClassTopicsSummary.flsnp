        <p>Using the Properties dialog, you can select an HTML style class for a topic. This is the outer tag in a topic, so the properties for this class will be applied to the entire topic. The following style classes are provided in the drop-down list: task, concept, reference, topic. These options are typically used if you are generating DITA output from the project. If you do not select any of these, the "topic" class is applied to the topic by default. If you want to use a custom style class instead, you can open the stylesheet, select the <span class="Emphasis">html</span> style, and create your own topic style class.</p>
