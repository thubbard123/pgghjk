            <p>Let's say you have added callouts and objects to hundreds of images of your company's software and inserted these images into a MadCap Flare project. Later, you receive updated images from your company's marketing team, showing changes to the software's interface. Rather than opening each image and replacing all of the callouts in the images manually, you can create a batch to replace the existing background images with the new background images. </p>
            <p>When you create the batch, any images that have the same name and file extension are automatically synced. You can manually set replacement images for images that do not align.</p>

                <img src="../../Images/batch_replace_image_background.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth80Percent" />
            </p>
            <p>You click <span class="Emphasis">OK</span> to replace the images. Any background images you aligned in the batch are replaced. The callouts and objects from the original image are transferred to the new background image.</p>
