        <p>After you capture an image, you may want to enlarge or reduce its background size. This is easily done by setting the scale factor or by changing the width or height. The image background will be resized according to the values that you enter. Any objects on the image (e.g., callouts, shapes, lines) will remain their original sizes, but you can always modify individual objects as necessary.</p>
