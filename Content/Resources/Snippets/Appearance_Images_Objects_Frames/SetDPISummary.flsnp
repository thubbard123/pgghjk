        <p>When you capture an image, you can set its resolution. An image's resolution is already set for online mediums based on the settings of the computer you are using. However, when working with print mediums, you need to set the image's DPI (dots per inch). As the name suggests, this setting determines how many dots are used per linear inch when printing an image. To ensure a better quality printout, you should specify a high DPI setting for printed output (say, 150 DPI).</p>
