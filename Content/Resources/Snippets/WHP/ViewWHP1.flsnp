        <p>When you test the output on your local computer, the output initially needs to be viewed by using the Flare interface (in order to generate the MCPreview folder). After that, you can view the output by using the Flare interface or by opening the file copies from the MCPreview folder. It is recommended that you use the MCPreview folder for subsequent viewings of <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.WebHelp Plus" /> output, rather than the Flare interface.</p>
