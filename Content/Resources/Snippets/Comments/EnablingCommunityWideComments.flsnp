        <p>If you want end users to be able to enter Feedback comments in the online output, you need to make sure comments are enabled. This is done by default in the skin. If you do not want to include comments, you can open the skin that is associated with the target, select the <span class="Emphasis">Community</span> tab, and click  <span class="Emphasis">Display topic comments at the end of each topic</span> to remove the check mark.</p>
