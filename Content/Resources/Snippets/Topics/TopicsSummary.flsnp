        <p>A topic is simply a chunk of information about a particular subject. Topics are the most important part of a Flare project. Everything else is contained within topics (e.g., cross-references, text, images) or points toward topics (e.g., tables of contents, indexes<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare">, browse sequences</MadCap:conditionalText>). The very reason end users open a <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare">Help system or </MadCap:conditionalText>manual is to find information, a little direction. They find that help within individual topics.</p>
