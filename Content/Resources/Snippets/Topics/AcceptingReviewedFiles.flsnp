    <body>After an individual returns a package that you have sent them for review, you can bring that <MadCap:keyword term="FLTREV file" MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare" />FLTREV file into your Flare project. Once the reviewed files (i.e., topics and snippets) within that package are inside your project, you can view and accept them. After accepting a file, it is converted to an <MadCap:keyword term="HTM" />HTM file (just like your regular files) and overwrites the source file in your project. Any edits or annotations (comments) in the reviewed file therefore become part of the original file.</body>
