        <p class="TableText">Adds a clipping mask frame to the object, allowing you to hide the area inside of the clipping mask frame. You must have an object in order to use clip, but you don't have to center the clip on the object. You might use a clipping mask if you have an object that you want to slowly reveal to your users. You can apply clipping masks to any object.</p>
