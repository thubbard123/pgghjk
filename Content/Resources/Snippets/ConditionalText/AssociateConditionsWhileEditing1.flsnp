        <p>When editing a document in the XML Editor, you can click <img src="../../Images/conditions_btn3.png" alt="" class="ReduceButtonSize" /> in the local toolbar to open the Conditional Text dialog and include and exclude conditions on that file. This is similar to the feature that you can use to preview a document with certain conditions set<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineLive"> (see <MadCap:xref href="../../../Topics/More_About_Topics/Previewing_Topics.htm">Previewing Topics</MadCap:xref>)</MadCap:conditionalText>. The difference is that this associates the conditions to the document <span class="EmphasisItalic">as you edit it</span> in the XML Editor. This does not affect the output in any way. It is simply a tool that lets you filter what is displayed in the XML Editor at any given moment, limiting the content shown to whatever target you have in mind as you are working on a topic.</p>
