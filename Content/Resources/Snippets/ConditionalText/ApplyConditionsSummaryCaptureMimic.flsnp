            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Capture">You can apply condition tags to  objects that have been added to images. You do not need to apply conditions to each and every object in an image, but rather only to those objects that should be included in some outputs but excluded from other outputs. If a particular object should always be included in the image, there is no need to apply a condition tag to it. </MadCap:conditionalText>
            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Mimic">After you create condition tags or link to a Flare project, you can apply those condition tags to the appropriate parts of your Mimic collections and movies. </MadCap:conditionalText>
