        <p>A condition tag set is used to hold condition tags you create for your project. Flare's factory templates may provide you with an initial condition tag set, which contains different condition tags (depending on which template you select) to help get you started. You can create as many additional condition tags as you want for that condition tag set. However, if for some reason you want more condition tag sets to hold even more condition tags, you can easily add them. Any condition tag sets that you add can be used in the same project and in the same outputs (e.g., if you have 18 condition tag sets, you can use conditions from all of those 18 condition tag sets in the same output generated from a project).</p>
