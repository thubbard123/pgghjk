        <p>view a list of all files where you have condition tags in the content, but those condition tags have not been defined. This might occur, for example, if you have applied a condition tag in a topic and then later change the name of the tag or condition tag set. The old tag or set name is still used at the location where it was previously applied in the topic. Therefore, a problem exists. From the Undefined Condition Tags window pane, you can open the file in question and fix the undefined condition tag. You can also quickly rename or remove multiple condition tag occurrences in a single batch, add the undefined tag to the project, or map the undefined tag to an existing condition tag.</p>
