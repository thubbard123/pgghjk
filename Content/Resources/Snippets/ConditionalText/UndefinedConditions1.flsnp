        <p>There may be times when you have an undefined condition tag in your project. For example, you might have a condition tag that you've applied to content and then included or excluded in some targets. But then you delete that condition tag for some reason. In that case, there are still references to that deleted condition tag in topics or targets, but the condition no longer exists in the tag set, so it's considered an undefined condition tag. If this occurs and you open the Conditional Text tab in the Target Editor (or the Properties dialog for a topic in the case of snippet conditions), you will see a reference to that undefined condition tag in the Basic view. You can then remove the reference to the undefined condition tag.</p>
