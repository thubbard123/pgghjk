        <p class="TableText">Displays the kind of "exclude" action tied to the condition tag. In most cases, the exclude action is "remove." However, in some instances, this action might be "unbind." For example, you might have the unbind action for a condition tag if you have applied the tag to a hyperlink and want the link to be removed from the text in some outputs, but you still want the text to be shown in those outputs.</p>
