        <p>There may be times when you see an undefined condition tag (when you are associating conditions while editing, or when applying conditions to content). For example, the Flare author might have renamed a condition tag set and forgot to update the links to content using those conditions. In that case, there are still references to the old condition tag, but the condition no longer exists in the tag set, so it's considered an undefined condition tag. If this occurs, you will see a reference to that undefined condition tag in the Basic view. You can then inform the author, or you can remove the reference to the undefined condition tag.</p>
