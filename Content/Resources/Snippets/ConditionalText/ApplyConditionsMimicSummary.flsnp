        <p>You can apply condition tags to three different kinds of elements, thus indicating that those elements should be included in any output that does not specifically exclude them. First, you can apply conditions to <MadCap:keyword term="Conditions:objects;Objects:condition tags" />objects that have been added to movie frames. Second, you can apply conditions to entire <MadCap:keyword term="Conditions:frames;Frames:condition tags" />frames within a movie. And third, if you have created a collection—as opposed to a standalone movie—you can also apply condition tags to each <MadCap:keyword term="Conditions:movies;Movies:condition tags" />movie. You do not need to apply conditions to each and every element that you come across, but rather only to those elements that should be included in some outputs but excluded from other outputs. If a particular element should always be included in the output, there is no need to apply a condition tag to it.</p>
