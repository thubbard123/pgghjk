        <p class="Warning" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: Red;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Warning: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">When you switch between the Basic and the Advanced view, your work is preserved independently in both. However, be cautious when using the copy button. Because of the way this feature is designed, it is a best practice to use <span class="EmphasisItalic">either</span> the Basic section or the Advanced section in the long term, <span class="EmphasisItalic">but not both</span>. Although it is possible to copy expressions from the Basic to the Advanced section, and this can save you lots of time, you should not try to switch between sections over time. The reason for this is that every time you make changes in the Basic section and click the button to copy the expression to the Advanced area, your previous advanced expression will be overwritten.</p>
