This means that anyone making changes to a particular row style using the Responsive Layout window pane will be affecting any other responsive layouts that are using that same style wherever they have been inserted throughout the project. You can remove the check mark from the <span class="Emphasis">Auto-save Stylesheet</span> option at the bottom of the window pane; however, if you do that, you will need to save your changes to both your content file <span class="EmphasisItalic">and</span> your stylesheet as you work.</p>
