        <p>Styles and media queries can be used to make your content responsive. This lets you present information—both its substance and structure—differently depending on the size of the screen or device. Flare provides a Responsive Layout window pane that helps you create this kind of content more easily. You also have the option of using third-party solutions (most notably the Zurb Foundation grid system) by adding the appropriate styles in your stylesheets and topics.</p>
