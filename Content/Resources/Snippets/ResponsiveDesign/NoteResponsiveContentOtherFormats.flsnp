However, you will notice that best results are achieved with HTML5 targets, and in particular, Top Navigation output. Many of the other formats are able to produce responsive content only in very basic ways.</p>
            <p>Also, even though the Responsive Layout window pane is designed with only online output in mind, the content you add to the layouts will show up in other outputs, including print-based outputs (unless you condition that content out). You can open your stylesheet, choose the print medium, and edit the resulting div and complex selectors that were created from a responsive layout. You just might find that you are able to reuse those layouts in your print-based outputs, depending on the simplicity of the responsive layout and the style settings that you provide for the print output.</p>
