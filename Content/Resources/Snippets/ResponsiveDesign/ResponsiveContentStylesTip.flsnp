If you create a grid where the content in each cell is exactly the same size, you're likely to have a much easier time configuring your layout. But if you have different types of content in your cells, or content that requires more space in some cells than others, you might need to use additional styles and properties in your stylesheet. For example, the "height" property can be quite useful to keep all of your cells looking the same. In the Stylesheet Editor, you would expand <span class="Emphasis">(Complex Selectors)</span>, choose your main selector (e.g., if your layout is named "Grid," you would select <span class="Emphasis">div.Grid &gt; div</span>) and then complete the height or other settings to the right.</p>
            <p>Also, embedded videos can be tricky within responsive layouts. That's why we created the following additional video-related styles in the StylesForHomePage stylesheets in our Top Navigation project templates: ..video, video-section, and .video-wrapper. If you open the Home page topic in one of these Top Navigation templates, you will see that we used a combination of these styles and responsive layouts to display the videos. If you want to include videos in your responsive grids, you might consider creating additional styles like these, or you can just import these same styles from the template into your own stylesheet.</p>
