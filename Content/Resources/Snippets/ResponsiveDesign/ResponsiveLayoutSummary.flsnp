        <p>For HTML5 output, you can use the Responsive Layout window pane to help you design responsive content. This window pane lets you create a one-row grid to hold content. The benefit of putting your content into such a grid is that it allows it to shift and be responsive to screens of different sizes. The <MadCap:xref href="../../../Tutorials/Flare/Tutorials.htm" MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineLive" MadCap:excludeAction="unbind">Tutorials</MadCap:xref> topic in Flare's Help system is one example where such a responsive layout is used.</p>
