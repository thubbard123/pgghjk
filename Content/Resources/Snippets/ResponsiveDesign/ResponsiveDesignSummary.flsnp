        <p>Responsive web design (RWD) is a way to construct your HTML5 output so that the display is adjusted automatically depending on the device.  Therefore, on tablets and smart phones, users will see a condensed look  that is more appropriate for those devices, compared with larger monitors. You can get the same effect if you shrink your browser to a smaller size.</p>
