        <p>In previous versions, <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> supported only project-level custom dictionaries for spell checking purposes. By "project-level," we mean that the dictionaries you created were tied to specific projects<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare"> and located in the Advanced folder of the Project Organizer</MadCap:conditionalText>. These types of dictionaries are still supported. But now you also have the option of creating global dictionaries.<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineLive"> See <MadCap:xref href="../../../Dictionaries/About_Dictionaries.htm">About Dictionaries</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
