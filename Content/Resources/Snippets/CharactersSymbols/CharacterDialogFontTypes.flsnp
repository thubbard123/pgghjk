        <p>In the Character dialog, you can select different font types when inserting a character. If you insert a character with "(normal text)" selected in the Font field, that character will use the same font properties of the content where it is being inserted. But if you select a specific font in the Font field, the character will instead use those properties at the point of insertion, which will result in a &lt;span&gt; tag being created. </p>
