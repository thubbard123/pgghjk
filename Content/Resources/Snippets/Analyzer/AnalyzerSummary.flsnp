        <p>Analyzer is a tool that lets you scan your project to find and fix issues, as well as create reports that display the information captured. There are two versions of Analyzer—internal and external. To take full advantage of the power of Analyzer, you must purchase the full external version, which provides access to all of the features. The internal Analyzer is a lighter version that is built in to the <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> interface, allowing you to use some Analyzer features.</p>
