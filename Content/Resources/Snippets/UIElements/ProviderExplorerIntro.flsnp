        <p>The Source Control Explorer is used to view and manage source control-related files and settings for your project. This window pane collects all source control information in one place so you do not need to open multiple windows or tabs when working with projects that are bound to source control. It does not replace the Source Control ribbon<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare"> or Pending Changes window</MadCap:conditionalText>; instead, it gathers all of this information in one place. Here, you can bind and unbind a project, see pending changes, import a project from source control, manage branches (when using Git), and access network settings (when using Git or Subversion).</p>
