        <p>You can create a Quick Access toolbar at the top of the workspace to display options that you use most often. When options are added to the Quick Access toolbar, they are easily accessible, regardless of the ribbon that is open.</p>
        <p>By default the Save, Save All, Undo, and Redo buttons are already added to the toolbar. However, you can add others as well.</p>
