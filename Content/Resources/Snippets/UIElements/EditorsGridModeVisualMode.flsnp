        <p><MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />'s Translation Editor allows you to work in Translation (or grid) mode, with the source content in one column and the target language in the next column. For some types of files—such as Flare topics, snippets, and master pages; Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint, and Word documents; DITA files; HTML files; and XML files—you can also switch to Live Preview mode, which allows you to view content in its intended context. A suggestions area at the bottom of the Translation Editor lets you quickly select and insert matching translations from your translation memory (TM) database.</p>
