        <p MadCap:conditions="Products.Capture">Lets you see what the image will look like with condition tags included or excluded in the output. In order to use this preview feature, you need to double-click the image and use the Conditional Text tab to include or exclude certain tags. Then when you click the Preview Conditions button, the objects that have condition tags set to be shown will still appear, but the objects that have condition tags set to be excluded will be hidden. This is simply a way to test your conditions before saving the image. See <MadCap:xref href="../../../Condition_Tags/Previewing_Conditions.htm">Previewing Conditions</MadCap:xref>.</p>
