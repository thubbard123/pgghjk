        <p MadCap:conditions="Products.Capture">Opens the properties dialog for the selected object. It lets you perform tasks specific to the selected object. For example, if a rectangle is selected, this dialog lets you add shadow effects, add text, and set the color for the object. </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Products.Mimic">Opens the properties window pane for the following item types: frame, object, audio object, keyframe, or effect. It lets you perform tasks specific to the selected item. For example, if a rectangle is selected, this window pane lets you add keyframes, text, and set the color for the object. If a keyframe is selected, this window pane lets you modify the transition between the selected keyframe and the next. This window pane is dynamic. Once it is open, it automatically changes to the property type applicable to what you have clicked on. In other words, if you click an object, it changes to the Object Properties window pane. If you click an audio object, it changes to the Sound Properties window pane.</p>
