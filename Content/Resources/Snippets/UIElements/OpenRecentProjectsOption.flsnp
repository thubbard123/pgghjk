        <p value="1"> Displays a list of recently opened projects. You can select one from the list to open it. You can also select <span class="Emphasis">Manage Recent Projects</span>. This opens the Recent Projects dialog, which lets you remove projects from the list of recently opened projects. This allows you to keep the list shorter and more manageable. When you use this feature, the project is merely removed from the list, but the actual project is not deleted.
