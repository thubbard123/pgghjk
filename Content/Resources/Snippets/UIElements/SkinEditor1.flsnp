        <p>This editor displays when you open a skin file from the Project Organizer, and is used to develop a skin for one or more online targets in your project. A skin is a file that contains information about the appearance of the output window (such as its size and positioning, which buttons or tabs it should include, and style settings). The Skin Editor consists of several tabs, displaying only settings relevant to the selected skin type—<MadCap:variable name="Outputs.HTML5" /> (the recommended online output type), Standard (for most online outputs),  or WebHelp Mobile. You can also perform certain tasks for HTML5 skin components.</p>
