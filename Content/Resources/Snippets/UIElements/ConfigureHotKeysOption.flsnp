        <p class="TableText">Capture provides you with several different options for recording images. Some of these options have shortcut hot keys assigned to them. For example, the default shortcut for capturing a full screen image is CTRL+SHIFT+F. If you want, you can change the hot key combinations for any of these options (e.g., you can change the CTRL+SHIFT+F shortcut to, say, CTRL+ALT+F). </p>
