        <p>If more than one window pane is open on either side, the panes are organized in an accordion or tab structure. This means that they are stacked on top of each other, with the active window pane displayed "in front" of the other panes. You can click any accordion bar or tab to bring that particular window pane "in front" so that you can work in it.</p>
