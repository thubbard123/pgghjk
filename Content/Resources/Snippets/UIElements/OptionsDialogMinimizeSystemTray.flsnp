        <p class="TableText">By default, when you minimize <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />, a shortcut button on the main part of the taskbar lets you reopen the application. However, you can select this check box if you want to minimize <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> to the system tray instead. With this option selected, a shortcut icon is placed in the system tray (i.e., notification area) of the taskbar when <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> is minimized. You can click on this icon and select <span class="Emphasis">Restore</span> to reopen the application. </p>
