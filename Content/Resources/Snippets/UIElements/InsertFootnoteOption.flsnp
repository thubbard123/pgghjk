        <p>Opens the Insert Footnote/Endnote dialog, which lets you insert a footnote or endnote. When inserting a footnote or endnote, an indicator (a number by default) is added at the location where your cursor is placed in the topic. Also, you can determine where the accompanying comment is inserted. A footnote is typically added at the end of a page, but you can also insert an endnote at the end of a document, chapter, section, or book.
