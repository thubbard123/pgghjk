        <p>Adds an annotation rectangle, extended to a sidebar to the right, with a line pointing to the selected content. This rectangle will hold annotation text after you type it. Also, the selected content is shaded, indicating that the annotation refers to that text. However, the shading will not be displayed in the output; it is for internal use only.
