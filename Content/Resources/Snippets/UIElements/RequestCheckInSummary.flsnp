        <p class="TableText">Opens the Send Request Check-In Message Dialog, which lets you ask another user to check in the selected files so that you can edit them.</p>
        <p class="TableText">If you attempt to check out a source control file and discover that another user already has that file checked out, you can automatically send a request to that user to check in the file. This is a completely automated process involving instant messaging or email. Not only are the messages sent to the appropriate individuals automatically, but the mechanisms for checking in and checking out the necessary files are built in to those messages. This means that you and the other authors on your team do not need to hunt down the correct files manually.</p>
