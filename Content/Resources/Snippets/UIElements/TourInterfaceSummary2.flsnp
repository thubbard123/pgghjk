        <p>For the most part, the <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare">explorers and </MadCap:conditionalText>window panes on the edges of the interface are used to support the work that you do in the middle. You have the flexibility to close or move elements around as you like, so it is not mandatory that every window pane remain permanently in its default location.</p>
