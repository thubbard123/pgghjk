        <p class="TableText">There are some dialogs in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> that open just once to give you a message or warning when something changes or you switch modes. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare">An example of this is the dialog that opens when you first switch between layout modes in the XML Editor. </MadCap:conditionalText>These dialogs have a check box labeled "Show this dialog." If you deselect that check box, you will not see the dialog again. However, you can use this reset feature to display that dialog (and all other "Show Once" dialogs) again the next time.</p>
