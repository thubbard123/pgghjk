    <body>lets you view  topic files in your Lingo project that appear in a specific table of contents (TOC). When you view a TOC, the files appear in the same tree structure that they use in the associated Flare project. This is especially useful if you are working with a very large Lingo project, because not only does it let you filter by topic files and by TOC, but it also lets you see the order of the topics and the way the topics fit together in the final output. </body>
