        <p class="TableText">Lets you manually synchronize the current Help topic with the TOC. In other words, the TOC book containing that topic also opens to show you where the topic resides in the TOC hierarchy. This feature is for topics and TOCs in the output. However, you can do much the same thing in the source files. If you right-click a topic in the Content Explorer or File List window pane, you can select <span class="Emphasis">Locate in TOC</span>. This opens the source TOC file and highlights all of the entries where the topic is linked. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../TOCs/More_About_Tables_of_Contents/Locating_Topics_in_TOCs.htm">Locating Topics in TOCs</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
