        <p>OpenType is a format that is extended from the earlier TrueType format, and can also contain PostScript data. It is an open standard under the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).</p>
        <p>The primary benefit of the OpenType format is that it has cross-platform support, which means that the same font can be viewed both on a PC and a Mac.</p>
        <p>To see an OpenType font in the <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> user interface, first make sure that font is installed on your computer. Refer to your operating system documentation for instructions on installing new fonts. You may need to close and re-open <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />, and perhaps restart your computer, in order to see the newly installed fonts.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare">OpenType fonts are supported in the XML Editor in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />, as well as in most output formats.</p>
