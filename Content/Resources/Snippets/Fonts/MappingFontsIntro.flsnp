        <p>If you are translating a project into multiple languages, you may need to use different fonts for each language. For example, if you translate a document into French, Chinese, and Arabic, each language uses different character sets. Using fonts appropriate for the language's character set ensures that the characters display correctly when viewed in the output. You can use Lingo's font mapping feature to locate the fonts already used in the source Flare project and replace them with fonts that are supported by each target language. The mapped fonts will be used when the project is exported back to Flare.</p>
