            <p MadCap:conditions="">You are translating a Flare project that was originally written in English. You need to translate it into French and Arabic. You know that each of these documents will use different fonts in the final output, so you use Lingo to create a font map.</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="">First you scan your project files for fonts. The files are currently using Arial, Calibri, and Cambria. This is fine for French, which does not need to display a special character set, and therefore does not need a special font. However, you need to use a different font for Arabic in order to support the language's character set. You switch the language to Arabic and map each of the fonts in your project to B Fantezy, which is an Arabic font.</p>

            <p MadCap:conditions="">When the author exports the Arabic project back to Flare, the output uses B Fantezy and all of the characters are supported.</p>
