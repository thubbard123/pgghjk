        <p>If you insert a snippet on a line where other content exists, it is inserted as a text snippet. Therefore, if you want to insert a snippet on a blank line and also type other text before or after it, you need to type the text first and then insert the snippet afterward. If you have a snippet containing multiple paragraphs and insert it within a line of text, the snippet becomes just one continuous line of text because it is a text snippet.</p>
