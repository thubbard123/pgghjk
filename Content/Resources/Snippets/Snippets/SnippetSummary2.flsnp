        <p>Snippets are  chunks of content that you can use in your project over and over. Think of them as miniature topics. It’s content that you want to reuse in many different topics, but you don’t want to have to keep retyping that content, so you just type it once in a snippet. Then you insert that snippet into as many topics as you need it to be in. You can even insert them into other snippets, creating nested snippets. Normally snippets are made up of one or more paragraphs, perhaps including elements such as lists, images, tables, or text. We’re not usually talking about single words or phrases here. That’s what variables are for.</p>
