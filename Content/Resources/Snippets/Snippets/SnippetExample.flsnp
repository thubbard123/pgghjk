            <p>Let's say you are writing a manual about dogs. In one topic, you have created a colorful table with images that lists the top five breeds. Let's say you want to place that same table in seven other topics. You have a choice. (1) You can re-create that table manually in each of those topics. (2) You can copy the first table and paste it into the other topics. This is a better solution, but if you need to make changes to the table in the future, you'll need to do so in all eight topics. (3) You can create a snippet from the table and insert it into each of the other topics. This is the best solution because, if you need to make changes in the future, you only need to do so within the snippet and the changes are automatically reflected in all eight topics.</p>
