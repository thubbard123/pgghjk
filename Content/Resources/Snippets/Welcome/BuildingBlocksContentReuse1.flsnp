        <p>In other authoring tools, you’re probably used to everything being a part of a single file—the content, the table of contents, the glossary, the styles, and so on. It’s not like that in Flare. Instead, most of the pieces are separate, sort of like building blocks. This is one of the things that helps to make Flare so powerful and give you so much flexibility in how to create your output.</p>
