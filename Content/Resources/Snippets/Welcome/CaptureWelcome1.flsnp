        <p>MadCap <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> lets you easily capture anything that displays on your computer screen and enhance the image using a variety of features. What makes <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> different from other screen capture tools is its tight integration with MadCap Flare and other applications in <MadCap:variable name="Other.CompanyName" />’s suite of native XML, multi-channel authoring software. This means you can take advantage of single-sourcing and other unique features such as condition tags, profiles, and palettes.</p>
