    <body>If the anchored frame contains an image along with callout text, the original image is imported <span class="EmphasisItalic">without</span> the callout text. You might select this option if you have resized the image in FrameMaker. With this option, the imported image is likely to be of a higher quality than it would be otherwise. You can then add a callout to the image once it is inside <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />.</body>
