        <p>One feature of <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> that may be new for <span>some <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.Frame" /></span> users is the concept of stylesheets. It is important to understand the critical role that stylesheets play in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />.</p>
        <p>Stylesheets are simply a collection of formatting rules that control the appearance of content in output. In <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />, all paragraph styles and character styles are contained in a stylesheet. A stylesheet completely replaces the Paragraph Designer, Character Designer, and Catalogs in <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.Frame" />. </p>
        <p>Stylesheets let you separate content from presentation. This makes it much easier to control a standard appearance for all of your content because you donâ€™t need to update every page when you want to make a change. A stylesheet gives you flexibility and control over the exact appearance of your content. With stylesheets you can control many properties, including specific fonts and font sizes; bold, italics, and underlining; text and background color; link color and underlining; and much more. By using stylesheets to control the look of your content, you can ensure a consistent appearance in the output. </p>
        <p>Most importantly, a stylesheet satisfies all the formatting requirements of a <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> project and removes the task of importing paragraph and character styles from other <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.Frame" /> documents. A change or update to a style is automatically reflected in all places where that style is used.</p>
