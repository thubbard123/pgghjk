        <p class="Subheading">.NET unhandled exception error occurs when attempting to include or exclude a condition tags</p>
        <p>A  Microsoft .NET Framework unhandled exception error when attempting to include or exclude a condition tag on a target with a non-alphanumeric character in its name.</p>
        <p class="Subheading">Cause</p>
        <p>This is caused because Flare does not currently support non-alphanumeric names for condition tags. There is currently a bug in Flare's Condition Tag Set Editor which allows you to name condition tags with non-alphanumeric characters. The exception error occurs when an attempt to set those conditions on a target in the Target Editor is made.</p>
        <p class="Subheading">Solution</p>
        <p>Refrain from naming conditions in the Condition Tag Set Editor with non-alphanumeric characters until the problem is addressed in a future version. </p>
