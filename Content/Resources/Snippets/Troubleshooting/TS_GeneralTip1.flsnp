        <p>Although it is possible to create topics or snippets that contain a great deal of content, it is recommended that you try to keep files sizes to a minimum. Try to break the content up and place it into multiple topics or snippets, rather than putting it all into one very long file. The more content that a file contains—especially pictures and multimedia—the longer it takes to load it.</p>
