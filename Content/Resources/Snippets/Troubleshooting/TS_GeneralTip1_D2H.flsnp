        <p class="Subheading">Error(s) and Unresolved Links</p>
        <p>When you build targets, any error messages will display in the Output window, in the tab named "Error(s) and Unresolved Links."</p>
        <p>The error messages include an explanation that will help you troubleshoot the issue.</p>
        <p>A project must have a table of contents (TOC), so if you see the error "There are no valid topics in the table of contents," you should click the <span class="Emphasis">Contents</span> accordion button in Doc-To-Help and check the TOC. If there are no items in it, you should add topics by dragging them from the Topics window. If no topics are in the Topics window, you need to check and see if your source documents contain heading styles.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>One of the most common errors is a broken link. These will be indicated by an icon that looks like a broken chain link <img src="../../Images/D2H/brokenlink.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" />. Double-clicking on the description of the broken link will open the topic containing that link so that you can fix it.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A message with a red X icon <img src="../../Images/D2H/redx.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" /> next to it must be fixed. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A message with an exclamation mark <img src="../../Images/D2H/warning.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" />&#160;is a warning and does not need to be fixed, but you may want to investigate it. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A message with a blue circle <img src="../../Images/D2H/informational.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" />&#160;next to it is informational.</p>
