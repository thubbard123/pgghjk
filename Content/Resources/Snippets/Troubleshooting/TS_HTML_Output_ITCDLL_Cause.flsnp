        <p>Typically, this is the result of an unregistered dynamic link library (DLL) file on the computer building the Help file. The DLL&#160;is named "itcc.dll"&#160;and is a component of Microsoft's CHM specification. Its purpose is to supply the operating system running Flare with the ability to build a CHM file with index and search capabilities.</p>
        <p>A variety of software vendors (particularly those that develop Help authoring tools) distribute a copy of the itcc.dll file along with their program installation files. Should you happen to install or uninstall program with a copy of this file (e.g., a Help tool or software program from another vendor or another MadCap software tool that requires this file), it is possible for other copies of the itcc.dll file to become unregistered.</p>
