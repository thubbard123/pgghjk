        <p class="Subheading">File Size Much Bigger Than Previously</p>
        <p>I built my target and the file size is significantly larger than the last build, even though I changed very little.</p>
        <p class="Subheading">Cause</p>
        <p>This may occur because there are too many files in the Temp folder of your Doc-To-Help project.</p>
        <p class="Subheading">Solution</p>
        <p>Open Windows Explorer, delete the Temp folder, and rebuild the target.&#160;The file size should be reduced. </p>
