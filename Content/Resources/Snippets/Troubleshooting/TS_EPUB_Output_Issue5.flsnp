        <p class="Subheading">Performance issues</p>
        <p class="Subheading">Cause</p>
        <p>This issue can occur if you have a large project with many topics, but there are no chapter or page breaks throughout. As a result, the EPUB output consists of one long file, instead of several smaller ones. A single long file can result in performance issues, both in generating the output and navigating from page to page.</p>
        <p class="Subheading">Solution</p>
        <p>Make sure that you have page breaks on heading styles. See <MadCap:xref href="../../../Paragraphs/Page_Column_Breaks/Setting_Page_and_Column_Breaks.htm">Setting Page and Column Breaks</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>You can also specify chapter breaks in the TOC. See <MadCap:xref href="../../../Output/Printed_Output/More_About_Printed_Output/Specifying_Chapter_Breaks_for_Printed_Output.htm">Specifying Chapter and Page Layout Breaks</MadCap:xref>.</p>
