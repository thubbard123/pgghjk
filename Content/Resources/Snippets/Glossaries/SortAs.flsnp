    <body>Use a "Sort As" term if you want to sort a glossary term as something else.  This can be useful when a term begins with a symbol (e.g., place &lt;html&gt; in the "h" section, instead of at the top of the glossary), or if you are using character sets that need to be sorted phonetically.</body>
