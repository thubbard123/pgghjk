    <body>You can configure a target to convert glossary terms to links automatically when they are found in topics. In addition, there is a way to purposely ignore some terms so that they are not converted to links. This can be done by setting the mc-disable-glossary-terms property on a style. By default, this feature is turned on for h1 through h6 styles, as well as hyperlinks (i.e., content with the &lt;a&gt; tag). This means that if a glossary term is found in a heading or text hyperlink, it will not be converted to a link. However, if the same term is found in, say, a regular paragraph, the term will be converted to a link (as long as you do not turn this feature on for that paragraph style). </body>
