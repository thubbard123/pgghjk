        <p>This will find glossary term links in your content files where the text exactly matches what is in the old version of the glossary (before you made changes). It will update those glossary term links with your changes from the new version of the glossary and save that glossary file. If you do not select this option, the glossary term links will not be updated in the content files.</p>
