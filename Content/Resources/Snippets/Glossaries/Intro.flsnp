        <p>"Sort As"&#160;links can be useful for several reasons. You can use them if a keyword begins with a symbol (e.g., place &lt;html&gt; in the "h" section, instead of at the top) or if you want to sort acronyms based on their full spelling. You can also use "Sort As"&#160;links when working with multilingual documents, such as when you are using character sets that should be sorted phonetically. </p>
