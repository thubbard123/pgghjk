        <p>view a list of all files where you have glossary term links inserted into content, but those glossary terms do not appear in any of your glossary files. This might occur, for example, if you have created a new term in a glossary and then inserted that term into a topic as a glossary term link. Later, you remove that term from the glossary. You now have a glossary term link in a topic, but the term no longer exists in the glossary. Therefore, a problem exists. You need to either remove the glossary term link from the content, or you need to add the term to the glossary again. From the Undefined Glossary Term Links window pane, you can quickly unbind or rename multiple glossary term link occurrences in a single batch, add a new glossary term, or map the undefined term to an existing glossary term.</p>
