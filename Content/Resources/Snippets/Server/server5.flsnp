        <p>When your annual MadCap Central subscription is close to its expiration date, you can renew it. You do not need to contact MadCap Software to do this; instead, you can renew your subscription directly from the Central interface. This option is visible only if you have an annual subscription that is not set to renew automatically. If you have a month-to-month subscription that automatically renews, you will not see this option.</p>
