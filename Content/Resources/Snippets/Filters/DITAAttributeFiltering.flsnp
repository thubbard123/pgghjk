        <p>You can filter DITA files to include one or more conditional attributes. The resulting Lingo project will include all of the translatable files that are marked with the selected attributes (while excluding those that are not selected). Additionally, because Lingo supports block-level and inline attributes, content within a segment that is marked with an excluded attribute will also be excluded from a filtered Lingo project.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Snippets.Snippet8">If you use conditional attributes to filter your Lingo project, the filtered content and files will be used throughout your project when running reports, creating bundles, and performing other tasks. For example, if you pull a report, you will only see data from the filtered content. If you make a bundle, you will only be able to select from files that are included in the project.</p>
