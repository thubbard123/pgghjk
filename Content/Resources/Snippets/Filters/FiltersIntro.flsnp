    <body>When creating a project in Lingo, you can use a filter to translate only specific content in a folder or in certain file types. Filters allow you to set restrictions on the content in a file or folder that is available for translation. Filters are available for <MadCap:keyword term="DOCX file:Microsoft Word;Microsoft Word:DOCX;DOCX file;DOC file" />Word, <MadCap:keyword term="Microsoft Excel;XLS File" />Excel, <MadCap:keyword term="TXT file" />text, and <MadCap:keyword term="XML;XML:file" />XML files. You can also add filters to unsupported file types using a text file type filter. Filters are also available for folders, so you can choose the file types in the folder that you want to translate.</body>
