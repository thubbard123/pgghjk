            <p>The content author filtered her Flare project to exclude a "Do Not Translate" condition tag. Of the nine lines in the original topic (including the heading), four were marked with a "Do Not Translate" condition tag. </p>

            <p>When you view the topic in the Translation Editor, only five segments appear in Lingo. This is because four lines were excluded when the project was created. Additionally, you see blue condition tag indicators in some segments where individual words were conditioned out and excluded from a segment.</p>
