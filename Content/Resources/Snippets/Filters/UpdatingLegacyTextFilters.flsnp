In Lingo 10 or newer, these regular expressions are combined into a single field. </p>
            <p>If you have a text filter that was created in Lingo 9.x or older, and you edit it in Lingo 10 or newer, the segment regular expression will be preserved. However, the notes regular expression is not preserved. You will need to manually update your text filter to include this logical grouping in the <span class="Emphasis">Segment/Note</span> field.</p>
