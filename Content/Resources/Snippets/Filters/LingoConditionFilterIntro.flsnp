        <p>You can filter Flare projects to exclude one or more conditions. You can also select conditions based on the entire condition set, or you can pick the specific conditions in the set that you want to filter by. The resulting Lingo project will include all of the translatable files that are not marked with the selected conditions. Additionally, because Lingo<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Snippets.Snippet11"> now</MadCap:conditionalText> supports block-level, inline, glossary, snippet, and CSS&#160;conditions<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Snippets.Snippet11"> (see <MadCap:xref href="../../../Introduction_Topics/Lingo/Whats_New_in_This_Version_Lingo.htm#ImprovedConditions">Improved Conditional Text Support</MadCap:xref>)</MadCap:conditionalText>, content within a file or segment that is marked with an excluded condition tag will also be excluded from a filtered Lingo project.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Snippets.Snippet8">If you use condition tags to filter your Lingo project, the filtered content and files will be used throughout your Lingo project when running reports, creating bundles, viewing glossary terms, and performing other tasks. For example, if you pull a report, you will only see data from the filtered content. If you make a bundle, you will only be able to select from files that are included in the project.</p>
