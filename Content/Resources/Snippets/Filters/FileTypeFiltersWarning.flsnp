This feature requires an understanding of advanced topics such as regular expressions, XML, and segmentation rules. </p>
            <p>Additionally, it is recommended that you are familiar with the file(s) you are importing prior to adding a filter. Some file type filters require you to select the specific content that you want to import (e.g., sheet labels, headers and footers, comments).</p>
