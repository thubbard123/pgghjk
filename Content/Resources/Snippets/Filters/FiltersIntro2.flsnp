        <p>When working with translations in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />, you can create different kinds of filters to control what content is translated in your <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> project. You can create filters for file types, targets, or conditions. You can also flatten snippets, variables, or DITA&#160;content references to determine what content is translated within a segment.</p>
