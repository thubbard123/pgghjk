For example, if you have condition tags A and B in your project, and you filter out A, you will see content marked with tag B in the project. However, if there is content marked with both tags in your project, it will also be excluded. This is because Lingo excludes anything marked with the A tag, even if the B tag was not also excluded.</p>
            <p>If you need to exclude some content and include other content, you can do this by filtering your project using a Flare target with your desired condition filters. Filtering by a Flare target respects both include and exclude condition tag filters.</p>
