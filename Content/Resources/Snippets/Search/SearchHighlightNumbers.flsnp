        <p>Each search highlight style is numbered to coordinate with the order search terms are entered. For example, the style named "Search Highlight 01" will be used for matches to the first search term entered and "Search Highlight 10" would coordinate with the tenth entered term. You can customize up to 10 highlight colors. </p>
