        <p>Flare has a hard-coded stop words list that works behind the scenes to filter out common structure-class words (i.e., function words) from search operations. This means the Flare search engine excludes words (e.g., "an,"&#160;"for,"&#160;"of, and "the") by default. However, if you want the search engine to search for queries with these words, you can include the stop words list in search. </p>
