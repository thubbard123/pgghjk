        <p>You can create synonyms within the Flare project, with the browser Admin for Pulse, or within Feedback Explorer. It is not mandatory that you have MadCap Pulse or Feedback in order to use synonyms in Flare output, but using MadCap Pulse or Feedback makes it much easier to determine which words require synonyms based on the search results of your users. Using the browser Admin for Pulse or the Feedback Explorer to create synonyms is appealing because the synonyms become immediately available for users searching in your output (without needing to republish the output). Be aware, however, that creating synonyms in Pulse or Feedback Explorer works for the output as long as you continue to publish output to the same server. If you create synonyms in Pulse or Feedback Explorer, it is recommended that you also create those synonyms at the source (i.e., within the Flare project), in case you ever publish to a different server. The easiest way to do this is to export the synonym file from the browser Admin for Pulse or the Feedback Explorer to the Project\Advanced folder in the Flare project.</p>
