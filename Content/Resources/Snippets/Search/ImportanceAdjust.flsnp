        <p>In HTML5 output, the Flare search engine uses a combination of factors to rank search results. When you search, the search engine considers the number of links to a topic (Importance) as well as the number of times a search term appears in a topic. This gives you the most accurate results. You can choose to turn off Importance and search using only the number of search term hits in each topic. This is not recommended unless you have one topic that is linked to so many times that it would skew your search results.</p>
