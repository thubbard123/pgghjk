        <p>You can change the number of search results that appear on each page. This makes it easier for users to navigate between pages of search results and improves loading times, especially for users who access your output from a mobile device. Setting a reasonable number of results per page also makes it easier  for search indexing services (i.e., spiders, crawlers, or bots) to locate pages in your output, improving search results.</p>
