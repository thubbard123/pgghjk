        <p>If you convert Word source documents to HTML5 source files in Doc-To-Help, and then build a target, stylesheets are created as a result and saved in the output folder. You can save those stylesheets in a different folder and then use this page of the wizard to point to them, bringing them into Flare in one merged CSS file.</p>
