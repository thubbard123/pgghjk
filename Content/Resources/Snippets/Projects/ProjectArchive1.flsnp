        <p>You might archive a project if you want to keep a copy of the files in the cloud, but you no longer need the output. An archived project cannot be opened or viewed, and all outputs become inaccessible. If you have a build for the project set to “Live,” you cannot archive the project unless you first remove the “Live” setting on that build.</p>
