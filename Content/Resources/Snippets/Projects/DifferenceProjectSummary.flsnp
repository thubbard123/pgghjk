        <p>Let's say you have already created a Lingo project for an earlier version of a particular project or document. You have already translated it, exported it to a new project or file, and given it to the author. </p>
        <p>Sometime after this, the author makes many changes to the project or file (in the source language). Now the author needs you to translate those changes into the target language. </p>
        <p>When this occurs, choose <span class="Emphasis">File&gt;Update Project</span> and select the newest version of the source project or file that you are translating. <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> scans the source files that have changed and updates the current project accordingly. A progress dialog displays temporarily and the <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> project is reloaded. </p>
        <p>If the changed source file has segments that exactly match those in <MadCap:keyword term="Translation memory" />TM, the segments automatically receive those translations. </p>
        <p>If there are changes where matches do not occur in TM, those changes are reflected in the Lingo project in a couple of ways. First, the Difference column in the File List window pane indicates whether a file has changed. Also, if you switch to Preview mode in the <MadCap:keyword term="Translation Editor" />Translation Editor (for files such as Word documents, PowerPoint files, and Flare topics, which can be displayed in that mode), icons are displayed next to segments that have been changed.</p>
