        <p>The Projects page displays a grid, which shows all MadCap Flare projects that have been uploaded to your Central license. These are copies of the local projects located on users’ desktops. The main reason for uploading (i.e., binding) Flare projects is to let Central host your output; it’s a way to publish without having to involve an IT department. A secondary reason is that the connection between your local Flare project files and the cloned files on Central can be used as a source control solution.</p>
