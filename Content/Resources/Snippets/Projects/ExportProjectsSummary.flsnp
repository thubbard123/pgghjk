        <p>When all of the content in a project or file is translated, you can export the work to the application, file, or location. For example, if a Flare project was translated, you can export your work out to a new Flare project; if a Word document was translated, you can export your work out to a new Word document. This translated project or file can then be opened, and output can be created from it.</p>
