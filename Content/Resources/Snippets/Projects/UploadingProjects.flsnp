        <p>You do not have to be a Flare user in order to take advantage of the various features in MadCap Central. However, if you would like to add a Flare project to a Central license, you can upload the project from your desktop Flare application. A copy of the project will therefore reside in the cloud via Central, and you will be able to keep the local and cloud versions of the project synchronized using integrated source control. You will also be able to generate and publish Flare targets using Central.</p>
