        <p>In many cases, you can add additional files to a project after the project has been created.  This allows you to make changes to your Lingo project at any time without needing to create a new project. It also prevents you from having to send multiple projects to a translator or a reviewer.</p>
        <p>You can add files to any project created from other individual files, such as Word documents or XML&#160;files. You can also add files to any project created from folders.</p>
