        <p>In the Termbase Editor you can add one concept row at a time to a termbase. The advantage of this method is that, for each concept row you enter, you can also add variations of the term and more detailed information (e.g., source, definition, related term, context sentence, usage). In addition, you do not need to have any files open for translation at the same time.</p>
