        <p>TBX is an open, XML-based standard used for exchanging structured terminological data. It has been approved as an international standard by the <MadCap:keyword term="Language support" />Localization Industry Standards Association (LISA) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). One difference between a TBX file and a Translation Memory eXchange (TMX) file is that a TBX file handles multiple languages, whereas a TMX file handles only two languages.</p>
