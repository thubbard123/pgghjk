    <body>CSV&#160;is a plain text file format that uses line breaks to separate characters. It is supported by common applications such as Microsoft Excel. While a TermBase eXchange (TBX) file is the standard for compiling termbases, you can use a program like Excel to build and maintain your termbase, and then import it to Lingo using CSV.</body>
