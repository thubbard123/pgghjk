        <p>You can add many different terms at the same time to a termbase. For example, you might need to add a list of corporate terms from an email. The obvious advantage of this method is that you can quickly add lots of different terms. In addition, you do not need to have any files open for translation at the same time. When you do this, the terms are added as new concept rows in the Termbase Editor.</p>
