        <p>When you create your Lingo project, you have the option to add a language skin to your project. This generates a language skin file (LanguageSkin.fllng) containing several terms used in different Flare skins (e.g., "Table of Contents,"&#160;"Glossary,"&#160;"Home"). Translators can open the language skin file to translate these terms. This is especially useful if there are custom terms in the Flare skin and they need to be translated to match the custom interface.</p>
