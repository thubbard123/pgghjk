    <body><MadCap:variable name="Other.Product">[%=Other.Product%]</MadCap:variable> provides language skins for certain languages, such as French, German, and Spanish (i.e., many values are already translated). These are languages that are already identified as being "localized" skins. However, you can edit these default translations by creating a language skin for the language. For languages that do not provide default translations, you can create language skins so that they can be applied to the output too.</body>
