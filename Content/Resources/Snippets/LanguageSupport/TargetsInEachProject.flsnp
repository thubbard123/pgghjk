        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #bed230;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">Because Flare generates output from the linked targets in each of your project files, each linked project must have its own target file for the output you want to build (e.g., if you are creating PDF&#160;output, each linked project needs its own PDF target). If you do not have a needed target file in one of your linked projects, you will see a warning message before the build starts and you will be unable to build. Target files must be in the same relative location in each project.</p>
