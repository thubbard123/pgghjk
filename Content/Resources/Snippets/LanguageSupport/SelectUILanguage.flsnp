        <p>You have the option of viewing the interface in English, French, German, or Japanese. All of these languages are available from the same version of <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> (you do not need to purchase different versions for different languages). When you initially launch <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />, you are asked to select the order of your language preferences. Based on your selection, the user interface is displayed in the appropriate language, with the option to later switch your preferences at any time from the Select UI Language dialog. <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />'s user interface displays in the first language listed in your preferences. If, for any reason, a particular element is not available in that language, the element displays in the next language in the list, and so on.</p>
