        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.EclipseHelp" /> output type is designed specifically for content developers who want to use Flare to author an Eclipse Help plug-in. A plug-in lets you extend the existing Help contents that come with the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (IDE). It  requires an additional installation of the latest Java Runtime Environment (JRE)&#160;and Java version. This output type is particularly useful when you want to create  dynamic, searchable content that integrates into your Eclipse environment as a platform plug-in.</p>
