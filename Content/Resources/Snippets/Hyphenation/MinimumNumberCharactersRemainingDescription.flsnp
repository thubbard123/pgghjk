        <p class="TableText">Enter the minimum number of characters that must remain on the initial line when a word is hyphenated. For example, if you enter 4 in this field, a word that normally could be hyphenated after two characters would not be broken at that point. Instead, it would not be broken until at least four letters make an appearance on the first line.</p>
