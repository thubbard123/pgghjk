        <p>Locate the margin property that you want to change. Each side (bottom, left, right, top) has separate properties that you can set (e.g., margin-bottom, margin-left). However, if you plan to have the same settings for all four sides, you can simply use the main <span class="Emphasis">margin</span> property to set the values all the way around. When you click in the cell to the right of one of the properties (e.g., margin, margin-bottom), a small popup displays.</p>
