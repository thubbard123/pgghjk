        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #bed230;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">The Top Navigation Advanced template has two stylesheets. We modified the styles primarily in the one called "MainStyles.css," which is used for most of the topics. If you plan to use lists in the same way on the Home page topic, which uses the other stylesheet, you can make the same changes there as well.</p>
