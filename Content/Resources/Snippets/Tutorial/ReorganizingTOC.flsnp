        <p MadCap:conditions="">Before you convert your actual project, you should review and complete the preliminary tasks to make sure your output will work well with the new format. One of these preliminary tasks is the restructuring of the table of contents (TOC) so that the menu items in the output are not overwhelming. You may find that this task requires more time than any of the other steps when converting your project to Top Navigation, depending on the size of your TOC.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">In this lesson, we are going to organize the first level items in the TOC in order to limit the number of top menus. Otherwise, the menu would wrap around to two rows, and that doesn't look good. In your own project, you might need to also reorganize levels deeper than the first.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">If you are unable to reorganize your TOC, there are alternatives, such as hiding the top menu items.<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineLive"> For details, see <MadCap:xref href="../../../Output/HTML5_Output/HTML5_Top_Navigation_Output.htm#BeforeYouBegn">Before You Begin</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Print"> For details, see the online Help.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
