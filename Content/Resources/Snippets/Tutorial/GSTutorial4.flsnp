        <p>While you follow the steps in the Getting Started Tutorial, you will also use Flare's San Diego template to create a project about San Diego. This template was designed to be used alongside the tutorial and will give you hands-on experience in Flare. As such, some settings and content are not enabled when you first open the template. By following the steps in the self-paced tutorial, you can add the rest of the content to the template, and even use the template for other projects. </p>
        <p>You might want to take some time to familiarize yourself with the topics that have already been created for the San Diego template. You can find these in the Content Explorer on the left side of the interface. If you want, you can also select the <b>Project</b> ribbon at the top of the interface and click the <b>Build Primary</b> button to generate output from the template right away. This gives you an idea of how one type of output might look.</p>
