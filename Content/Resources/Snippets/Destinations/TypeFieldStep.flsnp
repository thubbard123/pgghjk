        <p>Click in the <span class="Emphasis">Type</span> drop-down field in the Destination Editor and select one of the following,  depending on which method you want to use to publish the output files: <span class="Emphasis"><MadCap:keyword term="File Transfer Protocol" />FTP</span>, <span class="Emphasis">File System</span>, <span class="Emphasis"><MadCap:keyword term="Secure File Transfer Protocol" />SFTP</span>, or <span class="Emphasis">Source Control</span>. Use the FTP (File Transfer Protocol) option if you want to publish output files to another computer over a TCP/IP network and you are not overly concerned with security. Use the File System option if you want to publish the output to a location on your computer or to another drive on a network. If you have previously connected to a SharePoint server<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineLive"> (see <MadCap:xref href="../../../Sharepoint/Connecting_to_a_Sharepoint_Server.htm">Connecting to a SharePoint Server</MadCap:xref>)</MadCap:conditionalText>, you can use the "File System" type to choose a folder on that server as the destination. Use the SFTP option if you need a much more secure option than FTP. Use the Source Control option if you want to publish your output files to a source control server, such as TFS&#160;or Subversion.</p>
