            <MadCap:keyword term="DotNet Help;Output:DotNet Help" /><MadCap:variable name="Outputs.DotNetHelp" /> is a Help output format developed by <MadCap:variable name="Other.CompanyName" /> for Windows desktop applications. It was designed to include the best attributes of <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.HTMLHelp" /> and <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.WebHelp" />, while filling the holes left behind by those formats. <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.DotNetHelp" /> is designed specifically to support Visual Studio developers. It includes a freely redistributable viewer <MadCap:keyword term="MadCap Help Viewer" />(MadCap Help Viewer), as well as components for the Visual Studio developer. These components can be dropped into your Flare project to facilitate context-sensitive Help, embedded Help, and features such as automated search string communication between the application and the <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.DotNetHelp" /> documentation. </p>
