    <body>A link is a feature that points to additional information from a specific area in a topic. The link may open information in the same topic, a different topic, or even a file outside of the project altogether. With print-based output the link can electronically open the destination if the user is viewing the manual online, depending on the type of output you create (e.g., XPS, PDF, XHTML, Word). In addition, cross-reference links can be customized to refer to specific content and page numbers in the printed manual (e.g., See "My Topic" on page 32).</body>
