    <body>Let's say you are developing a Help system for an employee time-reporting software application. You might have a group of related topics (e.g., Creating a Time Sheet, Changing a Time Sheet, Deleting a Time Sheet), and you want each of those topics to have the same Help control button that links to the same topics. So you might create a concept called "TimeSheets." You would then insert the keyword into each of those topics. After that, you insert a concept link into each of those topics, selecting the "Timesheets" keyword for that link.</body>
