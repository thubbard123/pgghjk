    <body>Let's say you have a heading style in a snippet and that snippet is then inserted into 12 different topics. In another topic, you might decide to create a cross-reference that points to the heading in that snippet. But which of those 12 topics is it supposed to point to in the output? There is no way for <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> to know this, so you could end up with some very undesirable results. For this reason, it's a good idea not to link to any content in a snippet.</body>
