    <body>Cross-references let you create automated links that are based on commands you provide. This allows you to keep links consistent and change them in just one place by using the MadCap:xref <MadCap:keyword term="XREF tag" />style (or a class of it that you have created). Cross-references can also be used to convert online links to page number references when you are producing printed output. You can  insert cross-references into content files.</body>
