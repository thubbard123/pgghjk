    <body>Expanding text is a feature that lets you collapse content in a paragraph in your topic. Let's say you have a bulleted list in a topic. After each bullet is a feature of the software program that you are explaining. You have given a detailed description of each feature, and now the topic seems to be getting quite lengthy. So you decide to condense each bulleted item so that users initially see only the name of the feature, which appears as a link (also called an "expanding text hotspot"). When users click that hotspot, the hidden content (i.e., the rest of the paragraph) "expands" and is displayed after the hotspot. When users click the hotspot again, the content becomes hidden once more.</body>
