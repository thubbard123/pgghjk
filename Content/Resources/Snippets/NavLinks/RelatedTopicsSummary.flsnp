    <body>A related topics link is a Help control that provides users with list of links to topics that you've specified as being related to the current topic. This is similar to a concept link. You should use a related topics link if you are applying it to a topic that you want to associate with specific topics but you do not plan to reuse the same link in other topics.</body>
