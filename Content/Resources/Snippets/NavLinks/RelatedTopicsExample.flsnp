    <body>Let's say you have an introduction topic for your Help system. You want to create a Help control navigation link at the bottom of that topic that links users to three other topics that you feel are particularly useful to new users. However, you do not intend to use this same navigation link in other topics. So you decide to create a related topics link because it is quicker than creating a concept link.</body>
