        <p>Although different kinds of individuals (e.g., authors, editors, documentation managers, other managers, IT personnel) might use Central for different purposes, users are generally classified into two broad groups—administrators and regulars users.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Administrators </span>This is the first person to log in to <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> using your company's license. This person can elevate other users to administrator status as well. An administrator is someone who has rights to one or more administrative tasks. This includes rights such as "User Administration," "Manage Teams/Projects," "Server Management," "Edit All Tasks," and more. A user might have rights to some administrative tasks but not to others.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Regular Users </span>If you do not have any administrative rights, you are a regular user. Depending on your the permissions granted to you by an administrator, you can perform tasks such as uploading projects and content; running and managing builds; and more.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Also, keep in mind that rights can be granted globally (i.e., for all projects) or on a per-project basis.</p>
