        <p>The first person to log in to <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> using your company's license has “User Administration” rights and can elevate other users to administrator status as well. There are many kinds of administrative rights, as well as some general permissions for managing Flare projects and builds. Only those with “User Administration” rights can set permissions for others. Also, keep in mind that permissions can be granted to a user globally (i.e., for all projects) or on a per-project basis.</p>
