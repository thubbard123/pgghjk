They are completely removed from teams, tasks, and projects.  If the user is re-invited to the license, they would have to be re-added to any teams, tasks, or projects that they previously belonged to.</p>
            <p>If a user belongs to other Central licenses, their profile and avatar are maintained and the user will still have access to those licenses. If they do not belong to any other licenses, their profile and avatar are deleted.</p>
            <p>It is not possible to recover a user's profile and avatar once they have been deleted. Instead, you would need to recreate the user and re-invite them to Central.</p>
