        <p>Administrators can assign users to teams and projects in the system. Assigning users to teams makes it easier to send messages to groups of people, as well as to see the activity for a team of users in one place. Assigning users to projects gives those users access to specific projects. Without access to a project, a user—even an administrator—cannot open that project to view it or work in it.</p>
