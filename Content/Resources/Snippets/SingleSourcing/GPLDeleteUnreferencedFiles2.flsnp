        <p>This feature is slightly different from "Delete stale files." When you tell Flare to delete stale files, you automatically sync the parent project with the child project when you've removed files in the parent. So in the example above, the Welcome.htm file would automatically be removed from the child project if you had also removed it from the parent project.</p>
