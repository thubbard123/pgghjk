        <p>Improvements have been made to how the Translation Editor handles conditional text and concept and index tags. Condition tags are now supported on block level and inline text, and also on glossary and index terms. Additionally, concept and index tags, which have always been supported, have been cleaned up to improve usability in the Translation Editor.</p>
