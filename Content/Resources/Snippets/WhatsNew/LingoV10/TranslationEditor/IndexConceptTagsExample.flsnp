            <p>When an author writes topics, she includes all of her topic's concept and index tags at the beginning of the topic, by the topic title. That way, when people click an index or related topic link in the output, they are directed to the top of the topic in the online Help. </p>

            <p>When the author imports her Flare project into Lingo, these tags are automatically removed from the segment. This way the tags do not clutter the beginning of each segment and you can translate just the important content. However, you can still translate these tags when you open the index keyword and concept keyword files in the File List.</p>
