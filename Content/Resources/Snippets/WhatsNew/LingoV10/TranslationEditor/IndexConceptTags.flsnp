        <p>In Lingo 10, if an index or concept tag appears at the beginning or end of a segment, it is no longer displayed in the Translation Editor. Removing these tags makes segments look cleaner in the Translation Editor, and prevents translators from needing to move tags that are not related to the segment. Additionally, these tags are no longer displayed in Live Preview mode. Tags are still displayed if they appear between two words.</p>
        <p>All  tags in a project are translatable when you open their associated file (e.g., index map, concept map) from the File List window pane. This content is added back to the segment when the project is exported.</p>
