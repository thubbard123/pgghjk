        <p>Condition tag support has been enhanced in Lingo 10. In previous versions, conditional text was only supported on files. Lingo 10 also supports block level and inline conditional text, as well as condition tags on glossary terms, snippets, and CSS&#160;styles. </p>
        <p>When you are working with segments in the Translation Editor, you will see yellow condition tags on either side of the content that is conditioned. Translators can drag these tags to the appropriate location in the target segment to indicate where the conditional text indicator should appear in the exported project. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineLive">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../../Translating_Files/Inline_Formatting_and_Tags.htm">Inline Formatting and Tags</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
        <p>Additionally, you can now filter content using condition tags. When creating a new Lingo project, you can filter out one or more conditions. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineLive">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../../Filters/Dynamic_Filtering.htm">Dynamic Filtering</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
