        <p>You can now filter the topics in your Lingo project using the TOC View window pane. This view allows you to filter the topics in your project by any table of contents (TOC)&#160;in the source Flare project. This is especially useful if you are working with a very large Lingo project, because not only does it let you filter by topic files and by TOC, but it also lets you see the order of the topics and the way the topics fit together in the final output.</p>
        <p>When in TOC&#160;View, you can also view topics' conditional indicators, save linked files for review, and create or merge translation bundles<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineLive"> (see <MadCap:xref href="../../../../../Bundles/About_Bundles.htm">About Bundles</MadCap:xref>)</MadCap:conditionalText>.</p>
