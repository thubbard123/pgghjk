        <p>Lingo now supports content references (conrefs) for translation. This is beneficial because it allows authors of DITA projects to translate reusable content elements in their project. In addition to supporting conrefs for translation, Lingo 10 allows you to replace conrefs with text in the Translation Editor. This is referred to as "flattening." </p>
