        <p>You can filter conditions and targets when creating a new project, or you can update an existing project's filtering settings on the Flare Settings tab of the Project Properties dialog (<span class="Emphasis">File&gt;Project Properties</span>). The settings are the same in both locations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Filter by target </span>Select this option, then select the target whose files you want to include in the Lingo project. Any files that are not part of that target will not be shown in the File List. If you want to replace variable definitions for a specific target, you can select variables from the <span class="Emphasis">Select variables to flatten</span> grid.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Filter out condition </span>Select this option, then click <span class="Emphasis">Select conditions</span>. In the dialog that opens, select the condition tag set(s) you want to exclude from the Lingo project from the grid on the left side of the dialog. Then select or deselect individual condition tags in each set from the grid on the right side of the dialog.</li>
