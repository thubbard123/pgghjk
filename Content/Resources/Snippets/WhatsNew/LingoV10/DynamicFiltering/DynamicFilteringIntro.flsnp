        <p>You can now filter a source Flare project by target or conditions. Filtering by target allows you to create a Lingo project that includes files in a specific Flare target, while filtering by condition removes files and content marked with specific conditions. Using filtering options narrows down large Flare projects or more easily breaks down large projects into smaller chunks based on conditions or targets.</p>
        <p>You can filter a project when creating a new project, or you can make changes to an existing project's filter settings using the Project Properties dialog. Settings are updated dynamically, so you do not need to update the project to apply the settings.</p>
