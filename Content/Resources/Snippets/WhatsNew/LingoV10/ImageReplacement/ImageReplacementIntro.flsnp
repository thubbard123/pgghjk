        <p> In previous versions of Lingo, if you wanted to replace images in your project, you would need to replace them individually, or you could replace them in you original Flare project and then update your Lingo project. New methods to replace images have been added to Lingo 10. You can now replace several images at once using a batch. This method also supports multilingual projects. You can also replace images in skins.</p>
