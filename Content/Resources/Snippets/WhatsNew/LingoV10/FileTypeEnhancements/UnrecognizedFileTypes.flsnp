        <p>Lingo now allows you to import any file type as a text file by using a text file filter and regular expressions. This is helpful if you work with files that use uncommon or custom file extensions.</p>
        <p>To import any file type, create a new Lingo project and add your file to Lingo. If you add a file type that Lingo does not recognize, you will see a warning image next to the file filter drop-down. </p>
        <p>To resolve this error, select an existing text file filter or create a new one using regular expressions. Adding a text file filter will treat the file as a text file and allow you to import and translate the file. If you do not select a filter, the file will be discarded when you create the project.</p>
        <p>You can also add unrecognized file types as part of a folder. If you do this, Lingo will notify you to apply a text filter to the appropriate files within the folder. If you do not apply a filter to the unrecognized files, they will be discarded from the folder upon project creation.</p>
