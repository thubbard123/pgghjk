        <p>In previous versions of Lingo, FrameMaker files were supported for translation, but you could not send translated files for review. In Lingo 10, you can now send translated FrameMaker files for review using Lingo's internal review process. </p>
        <p>When working with FrameMaker files in Lingo, you can save these files as a review package (<span class="Emphasis">File&gt;Review&gt;Save Review Package</span>). In the dialog that opens, select the files you want to send, then click <span class="Emphasis">Finish</span>. The files will be saved as a Lingo review package (.lirev).</p>
