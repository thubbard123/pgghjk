        <p>After you translate the index or glossary file, open the Project Properties dialog and select the <span class="Emphasis">Sort Order</span> tab. From here, you can see all of the index or glossary terms in your project, as well as the custom terms set for the source project, if applicable. If any of the translated terms need to be sorted using a different letter, you can add an entry in the <span class="Emphasis">Sort As</span> column. When the author exports the translated project to Flare, the index or glossary will use the new terms to alphabetize the entries.</p>
