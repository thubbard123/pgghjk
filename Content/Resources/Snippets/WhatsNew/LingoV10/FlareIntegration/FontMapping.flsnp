        <p>If you are translating a project into multiple languages, you may need to use different fonts for each language. Using fonts appropriate for the language's character set ensures that the characters display correctly when viewed in the output. You can use Lingo's font mapping feature to locate the fonts already used in the source Flare project and map them to fonts that are supported by each target language.</p>
        <p>To do this, open the Manage font Maps dialog (<span class="Emphasis">Resources&gt;Manage Font Mapping</span>) and create a font map, then edit it. In the dialog that opens, select the files you want to scan. Lingo will search these files and list the fonts currently being used. Then you can select the font you want to map to each original font. You can do this for each language in your project.</p>
        <p>When the translated project is exported, the Flare project will use the mapped fonts for each language.</p>
