        <p>If you have multiple objects on a canvas, you can now flatten them so they become part of the background. This is helpful when you want an image that can be used as a background for other images. Because flattened objects can no longer be selected or moved, there will be no variations in the background image behind any additional objects added to the image. Additionally, if you are bringing in captures or images from another tool, you can flatten them onto the background before adding callouts or other objects.</p>
