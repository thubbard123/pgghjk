        <p>The canvas has been updated to have a transparent background, which uses a gray and white checkered pattern. Previously, the image background was white. This industry-standard change makes it easier to distinguish between white areas of the image and background areas. This is especially useful when using Capture's new drawing tools<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineLive"> (see <MadCap:xref href="../../../../../Introduction_Topics/Capture/Whats_New_in_This_Version_Capture.htm#Drawing">Drawing Tools</MadCap:xref>)</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Print"> (see <MadCap:xref href="../../../../../PrintOnlyTopics/CapturePDFs/WhatsNewCaptureV7/Drawing_Tools.htm">Drawing Tools</MadCap:xref>)</MadCap:conditionalText>, because it makes it easy to identify erasures (erased areas show the transparent background) and areas of the drawing that are white.</p>
