        <p>You can replace a background image in the Capture Editor instead of deleting and adding the background image manually. In previous versions of Capture, you could replace a background on a single image. Now you can also create a batch that lets you replace the background on many images at the same time.</p>
        <p>To do this, select <span class="Emphasis">File&gt;New&gt;Batch Replace Images</span>. In the dialog, select the folder where the original images are saved. They will appear on the left side of the grid. Then click the <span class="Emphasis">Sync</span> button <img src="../../../../Images/sync_btn.png" alt="" title="" class="ReduceButtonSize" /> to select the folder where the new images are saved. Any images with the same file name and extension are automatically synced to the original images. If you need to manually replace an image (e.g., there wasn't an image with the same name, the image that synced needed to be recaptured), click the link on the right side of the grid to select a new image. You can preview all of the images using an image preview in the lower-left corner of the dialog.</p>
        <p>When you are ready to replace the images, click <span class="Emphasis">OK</span>. The original images will be replaced with the new background images that you selected. Any objects that were part of the original images will be transferred to the replacement background images.</p>
