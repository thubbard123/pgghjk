        <p>Whenever you add an object to a frame, you have the option to set up keyframes. Additionally, you can set some types of keyframes on clip effects that have been applied to objects. When viewing the Object or Effect Properties window pane, object and clip effect attributes (e.g., size, position) that can include keyframes are indicated by a yellow diamond button <img src="../../../Images/keyframe_btn.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" />. Objects and clip effects can include more than one keyframe type.</p>
