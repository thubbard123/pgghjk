    <body>Font groups organize fonts.  These groups are available in the Font Family field on the Home ribbon. They show both pinned fonts&#160;and all system fonts. You can collapse or expand any font group. This is a way to limit the list of fonts to those that you use the most and hide from view those that you do not use.</body>
