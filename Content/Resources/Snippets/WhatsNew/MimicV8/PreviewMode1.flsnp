        <p>Preview mode allows you to use Frame Editor to view an action set on an object. This prevents you from having to build movie output just to see how an action looks when it is executed. In other words, if you set a shape to turn green when it is clicked, you can use the Preview mode to see that action as soon as you set it up, without ever leaving Frame Editor. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineLive">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Steps/More/Using_Preview_Mode.htm">Using Preview Mode</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
