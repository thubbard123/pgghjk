        <p>In Mimic 7, you could edit trajectories for an object (such as a cursor) by hovering over an icon next to the cursor, then clicking and dragging the trajectory to its intended end point.</p>
        <p>Editing the trajectory for a cursor (or another object) works differently in Mimic 8. It is accomplished by using keyframes. The keyframes are created automatically for cursors when you record a new movie, but you can add more keyframes manually, just as you can for any other object.</p>
