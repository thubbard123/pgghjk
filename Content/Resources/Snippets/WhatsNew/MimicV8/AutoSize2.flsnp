        <p>Within a movie's properties you can set all objects to auto-size to fit text. This option is perfect when you have an existing movie that has several objects in it, or if you have just created a new movie that will contain one or more objects.</p>
        <p>To enable this setting, open or create a movie, then select <span class="Emphasis">Movie&gt;Properties</span>. In the Movie Properties dialog, select the <span class="Emphasis">Appearance</span> tab, then select <span class="Emphasis">Auto-size All Objects to Fit Text</span>. </p>
