        <p>If you open a source document in Word using  Full mode (see <MadCap:xref href="#modes">Dynamic Add-In Modes</MadCap:xref>), you can use three new panels to access build, progress, and project functionality found in the Doc-To-Help application. By using these panels, you can spend more time working  without having to switch back and forth between Word and Doc-To-Help. </p>
