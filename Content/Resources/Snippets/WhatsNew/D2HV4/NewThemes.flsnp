        <p>Three new themes have been added to the Doc-To-Help interface. You can now use the Accordion Logo, Tabs Logo, or Responsive Logo themes to easily create a project with a default logo already included in the output. </p>
        <p>Additionally, two stylesheets have been added to complement these themes and Doc-To-Help's existing themes. You can use the jquerymobile\green stylesheet with your Responsive or Responsive Logo themes, and the jquery-ui\green-sheen stylesheet with the Accordion, Accordion Logo, Tabs, and Tabs Logo themes.</p>
        <p>Doc-To-Help's default stylesheet and theme settings have been updated to use these new theme and stylesheet settings.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>By default, all new projects now use the Responsive theme. </p>
            </li>
            <li>The default stylesheet for the Responsive and Responsive Logo themes is jquerymobile\green.</li>
            <li>
                <p>The default stylesheet for the Tabs, Tabs Logo, Accordion, and Accordion Logo themes is jquery-ui\green-sheen.</p>
            </li>
