        <p>Doc-To-Help's source templates have been updated so any text that appears in the source template is used as the default text when you create a new document. This change has two main benefits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Simpler Source Templates </span>To prevent duplicate text when you build output, all extra information has been removed from the source templates (e.g., cover images, TOCs, index and glossary placeholders). This information has always been overwritten by the target template during build and is unnecessary in source templates.</li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Ability to Create Custom Templates </span>You can now edit Doc-To-Help's preinstalled templates to create custom templates. Any content in the source template is added to new documents when they are created. This is very useful if you frequently create documents using the same basic structure  (e.g., knowledge base article, user guide, brochure).</p>
