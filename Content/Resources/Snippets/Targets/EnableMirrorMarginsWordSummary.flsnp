        <p>Let’s say you create a page layout with mirror margins on pages (e.g., the odd pages are set up to have a left margin of 2 inches and a right margin of 1 inch, whereas the even pages are set up to have a left margin of 1 inch and a right margin of 2 inches). In such a case, Microsoft Word is unable to display the correct margins without a little help. Therefore, you need to enable mirror margins by selecting a single check box in the Target Editor. When you generate Word output, you will then see the appropriate margins on each page.</p>
