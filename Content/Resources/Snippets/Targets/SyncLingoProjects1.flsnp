        <p>If this option is enabled, the application detects whether any of the Lingo and Flare source files are out of sync. If they are, the Lingo project is automatically updated and these changes are also brought into the master Flare project. This is different from the usual process, where the translator would normally update the Lingo project manually and translate the changed or new files.</p>
