        <p>Following are two examples of multilingual output.</p>
        <p>In the first example, a Flare target points to other Flare projects that have been translated. This example also illustrates the process of adding a button (via a skin) so end users can switch between languages in online output. It also demonstrates out PDF output is generated from a multilingual project.</p>
        <p>In the second example, a Flare target points directly to Lingo projects. This is a more direct approach because it doesn't require the creation of additional Flare projects.</p>
