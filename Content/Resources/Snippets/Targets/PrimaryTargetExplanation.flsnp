            <MadCap:keyword term="Primary target" />What do we mean by this? It has to do with the final output of your project. When all is said and done with your project, you want your output to look and behave in a certain way. But not all authors have the same audience or work for the same company with the same needs and the same computer networking setup. Therefore, Flare lets you choose the best type of output for your needs.</p>
        <p>Now, in your project, you can use one or more of Flare's output types. You can even make copies of one output type and make changes to it. Each <i>instance</i> of an output type is called a "target."</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Targets;Output:types" />This concept of targets may seem a bit confusing if you are new to Flare. But don't worry. It will become much more clear as you become more familiar with Flare. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineLive">To learn about the subject of outputs and targets in more detail, including examples, see <MadCap:xref href="../../../Targets/Develop_Targets.htm">Developing Targets</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
