        <p>This page of the Wizard simply lets you select a <i>primary</i> target as you get your project off the ground. This means that—although you can use more than one target for your project—you will most likely use just one target most of the time. By selecting a primary target, you will be able to accomplish certain tasks for that target (e.g., build the final output) using shortcuts. </p>
        <p>Also, when you open topics in the XML Editor, they will be displayed by default with the styles and other specifications associated with the primary target. However, you can use the Layout and Medium drop-downs in the local toolbar of the XML Editor to view topics with other settings.</p>
        <p>Which output type do you choose for your target? Well, as you select each kind of output on this page, a description for it is given to the right. This description provides you with some information to help you make a decision. </p>
        <p>Do not worry if you're not yet sure of the best output type for your project. At this point, it is not worth worrying about too much. No matter which target you select now, you can always change the primary target later. </p>
