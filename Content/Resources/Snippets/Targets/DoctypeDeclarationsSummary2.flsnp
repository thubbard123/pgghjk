        <p>Quirks mode and strict mode have to do with the evolution of web browsers and the rules they use to interpret styles in cascading stylesheets (CSS). Quirks mode follows the old rules, and strict mode follows the new rules. If you are not concerned about which mode is used for your online output, you do not need to add the DOCTYPE declaration to topics. However, if you want to ensure that your output is interpreted and displayed using the newer strict mode, you should use this option.</p>
