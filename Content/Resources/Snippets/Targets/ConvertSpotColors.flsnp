        <p>Spot colors include things such as font color, background color, and so on (basically, everything except images). This is a quick way to produce a PDF that does not contain color. The alternative is to make sure that you do not have any color settings locally in topics, in your stylesheet (or medium), in page layouts, etc.  For example, you might create some PDFs in full color, but you might need to send one to a professional printer to be processed in black and white. So for that target, you select the option to convert spot colors to black and white.</p>
