            <p>Let's say you have a project that has many words that do not have direct translations, such as names. If you set a low threshold for untranslated text, Lingo will pick up all of these items in the QA&#160;report.</p>
            <p>In this report, the threshold is set at 10%. Because Lingo is picking up all of the untranslated names and showing these segments in the report, it is hard to find the one instance where the source was inadvertently copied to the target, about halfway down the report. </p>

            <p>If you adjust the threshold higher, it is easier to see possible errors. Here, the threshold is set at 60%. You can still see names that match in the source and target segment, but you can also see where a segment was accidentally copied over to the target segment.</p>
