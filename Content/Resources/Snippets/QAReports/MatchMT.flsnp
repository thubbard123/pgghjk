    <body><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Translations that match machine translation </span>This report compares the translated target segment with any available machine translations (MTs). This allows you to review your translations against the machine translations and make changes if necessary. You can change the threshold for the minimum MT match percentage, and you can set a minimum number of words in the segment (to prevent obvious matches, such as names or short phrases, from appearing in the results).</body>
