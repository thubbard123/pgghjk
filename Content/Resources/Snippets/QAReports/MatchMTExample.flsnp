            <p>Let's say you regularly send your Lingo projects out for translation. You want to make sure that your translators are not relying too heavily on MT, because your company uses several company-specific terms that are located in your concordance and in your translation memories, but would not be found in a translation from an MT.</p>
            <p>When you get your translations back from the translators, you run a QA&#160;report to see which translations match the MT. You set the percent match at 90% and the minimum word match to 4 words.</p>
            <p>When you look at the report, you can see which translations are at least a 90% match to the MT. You may want to review these translations to make sure that your translators made the appropriate adjustments to the machine-generated translations.</p>
