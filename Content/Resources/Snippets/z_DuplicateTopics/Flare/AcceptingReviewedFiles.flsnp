                        <MadCap:snippetText src="../../UIElements/SelectReviewRibbon.flsnp" /> In the <span class="Emphasis">Packages</span> section select <span class="Emphasis">File Reviews</span>. The File Reviews window pane opens.</li>
                    <li>Click in the drop-down field at the top of the window pane, select <span class="Emphasis">Inbox</span>. All reviewed files that you have brought into your project, but have not yet been accepted, are listed in the pane.</li>
                    <li>In the list, select the file that you want to accept.</li>
                    <li>In the local toolbar, click <img src="../../../Images/accept_topic_btn.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" />. A message opens (if there are unresolved changes), indicating that the unresolved changes will be accepted if the file is accepted. However, if a conflict exists (e.g., the original file in your project changed since the time you sent it out for review), a dialog opens to let you know of the issue. You can then take the appropriate action; you can merge the changes from the files, keep the edits from the reviewer (undoing your changes), or keep your edits (discarding those from the reviewer). See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Reviews_and_Contributions/Reviews/Merging_Reviewed_Files.htm">Merging Reviewed Files</MadCap:xref>.</li>

                        <MadCap:snippetText src="../../StepsGeneral/ClickOK.flsnp" /> The reviewed file replaces the source file in the project. Also, the file is removed from the File Reviews window pane.</li>
