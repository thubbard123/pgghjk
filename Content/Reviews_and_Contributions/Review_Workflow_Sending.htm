        <p>Following are the steps involved for sending files out for review:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">(Optional) You—Open File</span> Open a topic or snippet that you want to send for review. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineLive">See <MadCap:xref href="../Topics/More_About_Topics/Opening_Existing_Topics.htm">Opening Topics</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
                <p>If you intend to send multiple files for review at once, you do not need to open each one. You can use a wizard to add more files when you get to step 3.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">(Optional) You—Lock elements</span> If you want to ensure that the other individual(s) do not make changes to certain portions of the file, you can apply locks to specific elements within it. See <MadCap:xref href="../Locks/Locking_Elements.htm">Locking Elements</MadCap:xref>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">You—Send File to Reviewers</span> Email one or more files to other individuals for review. Alternatively, you can use the "Save Package" option to store the review package file in a location where the reviewer can access it, such as in a SharePoint or external resources folder. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineLive">See <MadCap:xref href="Reviews/Sending_Files_for_Review.htm">Sending Files for Review</MadCap:xref>, <MadCap:xref href="../Sharepoint/About_SharePoint_Integration.htm">About SharePoint Integration</MadCap:xref>, and <MadCap:xref href="../External_Resources/About_External_Resources.htm">About External Resources</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="FlareGuides.FlareReviewsAndContributionsGuide">See <MadCap:xref href="Reviews/Sending_Files_for_Review.htm">Sending Files for Review</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Reviewers—Open Review Package</span> The reviewers open review package (<MadCap:keyword term="FLTREV file" MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare" />.fltrev file) in Contributor or in Flare. </li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Reviewers—Insert Annotations/Make Edits</span> In Contributor or Flare, the reviewer inserts annotations and/or makes changes to the file (if full registered mode instead of annotation-only free mode). Changes are automatically tracked. Also, if the files you sent already had tracked changes in them, the reviewer can accept or reject those changes.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Reviewers—Save and Return Package</span> After finishing inserting annotations and/or making edits, the reviewer saves the package file and returns it to you (via email, SharePoint integration, or external resources).</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">You—Open File</span> Open the .fltrev package file. In the dialog that opens, you can choose to copy the review file into the inbox in the appropriate Flare project (so that you can integrate it back into the project), or you can choose to open the file in the Flare interface to simply view it.</li>
            <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/EmptyPageBreakAfter.flsnp" MadCap:conditions="FlareGuides.FlareReviewsAndContributionsGuide" />
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">You—Take Action on File</span> Do one of the following, depending on the option you selected.<ul class="FirstLevel"><li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">If You Copied the File to the Inbox in Your Flare Project</span> You can open your inbox in the Topic Reviews window pane to access the reviewed files (see <MadCap:xref href="Reviews/Viewing_Reviewed_Files_in_Inbox.htm">Viewing Reviewed Files in the Inbox</MadCap:xref>). Then you can do the following. <ul class="SecondLevel"><li><p><span class="SetOffSecondLevel">Accept Files </span>After you accept a reviewed file, it will overwrite the original file in your project. The new file will therefore include all annotations and tracked changes from the reviewed copy. The reviewed file will also be removed from the inbox. See <MadCap:xref href="Reviews/Accepting_Reviewed_Files.htm">Accepting Reviewed Files</MadCap:xref>. </p><p>If conflicts are detected, you can merge reviewed files. See <MadCap:xref href="Reviews/Merging_Reviewed_Files.htm">Merging Reviewed Files</MadCap:xref>.</p></li><li><span class="SetOffSecondLevel">Accept or Reject Tracked Changes </span>You can accept or reject tracked changes individually, or you can do this for all changes in the file. This can be done either in the reviewed file before it is accepted, or it can be done after the reviewed file is accepted. See <MadCap:xref href="Track_Changes/Accepting_or_Rejecting_Tracked_Changes.htm">Accepting or Rejecting Tracked Changes</MadCap:xref>.</li></ul></li><li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">If You Opened the File in Flare</span> You can quickly view the file, insert your own annotations and/or edit the file, and then send it back to the reviewer for more work.</li></ul></li>
