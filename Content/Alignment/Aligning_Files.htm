        <p>When you create an alignment project, the original and translated files are matched and aligned by name. Although it might not be a common occurrence, there are a variety of reasons that a file from the original project might not be aligned with the same file in the translated project. The important thing is that you identify any misalignment and then correct it. You can do this by using the File Map window pane in MadCap Align.</p>
        <p>The File Map window pane groups files found in both projects by file type. For each type, you can match the files together when necessary. There are a few operations for aligning files; you can shift the selected cells up and down, or swap two selected cells. After the files are aligned, you can manually upload them to your <MadCap:keyword term="Translation memory:databases" />translation memory database.</p>

                    <p>After creating an alignment project, let's say you open the File Map window pane and notice that all of the file rows are aligned with identical names, except for two skin files—"HTML5.flskn" and "Default.flskn." </p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="../Resources/Images/align_files_example1.png" class="MaxWidth90Percent" />
                    </p>
                    <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="LingoGuides.LingoAlignmentGuide" />
                    <p>To fix this you can select one of the misaligned cells (say, the "HTML5.flskn" file in the first column) and click the appropriate swap button.</p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="../Resources/Images/align_files_example2.png" class="MaxWidth90Percent" />
                    </p>
                    <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="LingoGuides.LingoAlignmentGuide" />
                    <p>The files become aligned, like this:</p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="../Resources/Images/align_files_example3.png" class="MaxWidth90Percent" />
                    </p>
                    <p>You can then upload the aligned files to the translation memory database.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="PageBreakBefore">You also might encounter situations where one file should actually align with two or more files.</p>
                <div class="example">
                    <p class="exampleHeadTextEmpty">example</p>
                    <p> Let's say that during the original translation, the topic "Topic.htm" was translated into Spanish and the resulting topic file name was also "Topic.htm." Later, however, an author split the topic in the original version into two separate files—Topic.htm and Topic2.htm. In the File Map window pane of an alignment project, the results might look like this (notice that about half of the segments are in the source Topic.htm file and the other half are in the source Topic2.htm file):</p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="../Resources/Images/align_files_example4.png" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                    </p>
                    <p> You can align and upload the files in order to store all of the translated data in translation memory. To do this, you would begin by aligning the first topic with the translated file. In the image above, this is already done (Topic.htm is aligned with Topic.htm on the right). Then you would double-click the row with the aligned files (Topic.htm and Topic2.htm). In the Alignment Tool, you would make sure the aligned segments are translated properly and use one of the buttons in the local toolbar to upload the file or selected segments to translation memory.</p>
                    <p>After this, you would close the Alignment Tool. Then, in the File Map window pane, you would align the Topic2.htm source file with the Topic.htm target file. For example, with the Topic.htm source cell selected, you can click <img src="../Resources/Images/swap_cell_with_below_btn.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" />. This will swap that cell with the Topic2.htm cell, like this:</p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="../Resources/Images/align_files_example5.png" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                    </p>
                    <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="LingoGuides.LingoAlignmentGuide" />
                    <p>Once this is done, you would double-click the row with the aligned files (i.e., Topic2.htm and Topic.htm). In the Alignment Tool, you would make sure the aligned segments are translated properly and use one of the buttons in the local toolbar to upload the file or selected segments to translation memory.</p>
