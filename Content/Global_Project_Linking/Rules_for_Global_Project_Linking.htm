                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Include Files Required </span>The Include Files field is mandatory. You can use wildcards, add specific file names, and specify multiple kinds of file types to include.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel"><MadCap:keyword term="Auto-reimport" />Auto-reimport Memory </span>If you use the Auto-Reimport check box, <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> will remember to not import any files that you have told it to exclude (either by using the Exclude Files field or by deselecting check marks in the Accept Imported Documents dialog). <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> will only import files that you told it to include (or did not specifically tell it to exclude), thus bringing in any new files added to the source project or any changes to files that you have imported before. If a file in the current project is newer than the same file in the source project, the source file will not automatically replace the current file.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Exclude Files Not Required </span>The Exclude Files field is optional. You can use wildcards, add specific file names, and specify multiple kinds of file types to exclude.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel"><MadCap:keyword term="Importing:conditions" />Condition Tags Not Required, But Recommended </span>The Import Conditions section is optional. It lets you include or exclude files that have any condition tags applied to them at the file level. If you decide to take advantage of Global Project Linking, it is highly recommended that you use condition tags when doing so. By applying condition tags to your files (e.g., topics, images, stylesheets, page layouts), you can more easily control which files are imported into (or excluded from) a particular project. This is especially true if you elect to use the "auto-reimport" feature, which automatically imports files that you specify when you generate targets.</li>
