        <p>In <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> there are many ways that you can link one file with another, thus creating a dependency. Link dependencies are created when you perform tasks such as: inserting a text hyperlink, inserting an image, applying a stylesheet to a topic, and more. The Link Viewer window pane lets you see what other files a particular file is linked to and from.</p>

                            <p>Let's say you have a topic called "What's New" and in several other topics you have inserted a hyperlink to it. Unfortunately, you cannot remember exactly which topics. Furthermore, you've made changes to the "What's New" topic, so you want to see if any other topics linking to it also require modifications as a result. Therefore, you open the Link Viewer window pane. You then open the "What's New" topic. Because that topic is the file containing focus, the Link Viewer window pane provides a list of all the other topics and files (e.g., tables of contents) with links to it. Not only can you see a list of files with links to the "What's New" topic, but you can double-click each file to open it and work on it.</p>

Another method is to right-click on the snippet within the topic and select <span class="Emphasis">Open Link</span>. But another quick method is to use the Link Viewer window pane, which not only lets you open the snippet quickly, but also see the file name of the snippet and other linked files at a glance. Therefore, you open the Link Viewer window pane. You then open the "What's New" topic. Because that topic is the file containing focus (i.e., it's the most recent file you've opened or clicked in), the Link Viewer window pane provides you with a list of all the other files linked from it.</p>

                        <p>Whenever you want to view links to and from a file, you simply need to open the Link Viewer window pane and give focus to the file in question. Following are two ways to do this:</p>

Next, open a file (e.g., topic, stylesheet, table of contents). As long as that file has focus (e.g., click in it), the related links are shown in the Link Viewer window pane.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>In one of the window panes containing files (e.g., Content Explorer, Project Organizer, File List window pane), right-click on a file and from the context menu select <span class="Emphasis">View Links</span>. If it's not already open, the Link Viewer window pane opens by default on the right side of the workspace, showing the related links.</li>
