            <MadCap:keyword term="Scan" />Scanning Dialog</h1>
        <p>This dialog displays automatically when you open a Flare project in Analyzer. The dialog simply serves as a reminder that the Flare project is being scanned for issues. You can see the scanning progress in the status bar at the bottom of the interface. For larger projects, this process might take awhile. However, you can close the dialog and work in the interface while the scanning continues. When the scanning process finishes, all issues found are displayed in the Analyzer Summary window pane, and the other window panes in the interface are completely populated.
