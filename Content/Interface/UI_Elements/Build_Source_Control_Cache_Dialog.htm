            <MadCap:keyword term="Source control:cache dialog" />Build Source Control Cache Dialog</h1>
        <p>When you first open your project, this dialog may open. Click <span class="Emphasis">Yes</span> to build the source control cache. Doing this will increase your source control performance and allow you to have an accurate status on source control items in your project.</p>
        <p>Once the cache has been built for a project, you should not see this dialog again, unless you delete the "Source Control" folder in Windows. </p>
        <p> The source control cache is updated whenever you provide information. For example, if you check in 10 topics, the cache is updated with that information. The rest of the cache will be not built/out of date.</p>
