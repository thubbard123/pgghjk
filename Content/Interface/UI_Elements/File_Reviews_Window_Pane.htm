        <h1>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Reviews:files;Files:reviews" />File Reviews Window Pane</h1>
        <p>This window pane lets you work with review documents (topics and snippets) that you have received from others. See <MadCap:xref href="../../Reviews_and_Contributions/About_Reviews_and_Contributions.htm">About  Reviews and Contributions</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>There are two different views in the window pane. The information in the window pane changes, depending on the view you select.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Inbox</span> This view shows files that reviewers have returned to you.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Sent Topics</span> This view shows files that you have sent for review.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To switch from one view to another, click the drop-down field at the top of the window pane and make your selection.</p>
        <p>Following are the primary tasks that you can perform in this window pane.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Reviewed Files (View and Accept) </span>
                <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/ReviewsContributions/ReviewsSummary.flsnp" /> See <MadCap:xref href="../../Reviews_and_Contributions/Reviews/Viewing_Reviewed_Files_in_Inbox.htm">Viewing Reviewed Files in the Inbox</MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="../../Reviews_and_Contributions/Reviews/Accepting_Reviewed_Files.htm">Accepting Reviewed Files</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Reviewed Files (Import) </span>You can import reviewed files into the inbox. After that, you can view and/or accept the files. You might use this feature, for example, if you have received a file from a reviewer, but rather than immediately sending the file to your inbox from the email message, you saved it to your local drive. See <MadCap:xref href="../../Reviews_and_Contributions/Reviews/Importing_Reviewed_Files.htm">Importing Reviewed Files</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Sent Files (View) </span>You can view a list of all files that you have sent to others for review. If you double-click a file from the list, it opens in the XML Editor. See <MadCap:xref href="../../Reviews_and_Contributions/Reviews/Viewing_Files_Sent_for_Review.htm">Viewing Files Sent for Review</MadCap:xref>.</li>
        </ul>
