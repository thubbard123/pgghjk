            <MadCap:keyword term="Databases:refresh dialog" />Waiting for Database Refresh Dialog</h1>
        <p>This dialog opens if you are attempting to perform an action in the <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> interface but the current project is still being scanned by Analyzer for issues. Typically, larger projects take more time to refresh than smaller ones.</p>
        <p>Although you have the ability to click the <span class="Emphasis">Close</span> button and continue working, it is recommended that you allow the refresh process to finish. This will ensure that the Analyzer database is up-to-date. Once complete, this dialog closes and you can continue working. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Analyzer">After Analyzer finishes updating the database, you can press F5 to refresh any pane and show the latest results.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
