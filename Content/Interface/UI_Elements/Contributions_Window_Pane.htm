            <MadCap:keyword term="Contributions" />Contributions Window Pane</h1>
        <p>This window pane lets you work with contribution documents and templates. See <MadCap:xref href="../../Reviews_and_Contributions/About_Reviews_and_Contributions.htm">About  Reviews and Contributions</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>There are two different views in the window pane. The information in the window pane changes, depending on the view you select.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Contributions </span>This view shows contribution topics that you have received from others. </li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Templates </span>This view shows contribution templates that you have created.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To switch from one view to another, click the drop-down field at the top of the window pane and make your selection.</p>
        <p>Following are the primary tasks that you can perform in this window pane.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Contribution Topics (View and Accept) </span>After an individual emails you an <MadCap:keyword term="MCCO file" />MCCO contribution topic, you can bring it into your <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> project, where you can view and accept it. After accepting the topic, it is converted to an <MadCap:keyword term="HTM" />HTM file (just like your regular topics) and added to your project. See <MadCap:xref href="../../Reviews_and_Contributions/Contributions/Viewing_Contribution_Files.htm">Viewing Contribution Files</MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="../../Reviews_and_Contributions/Contributions/Accepting_Contribution_Files.htm">Accepting Contribution Files</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Contribution Templates (Send) </span>You can quickly send one of your contribution templates to someone. That person can then use your template to create a new document and send it to you. See <MadCap:xref href="../../Reviews_and_Contributions/Contributions/Sending_Contribution_Templates.htm">Sending Contribution Templates</MadCap:xref>.</li>
        </ul>
