        <p MadCap:conditions="General.Future">add info on what else a primary target does. Affects the xml editor, what else?xxx</p>
        <p>You can have as many targets in a project as you want, and any of your targets can be built (generated) whenever you like. However, chances are that you will have one target that you work with more than the others. Therefore, you can set it as your primary target.</p>
        <p>When you first create a project, the Start New Project Wizard asks you to specify a primary target. The steps below show you how to change which target is the primary one.</p>
        <p>A primary target is treated just like any of your other targets, with one exception. There are certain shortcuts in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> that let you build, view, or publish your primary target more quickly.</p>
