            <MadCap:keyword term="Team authoring" />Removing Backup Files from the Repository</h1>
        <p>By default, Doc-To-Help keeps all versions of all files—including source files, auxiliary files, and the D2H project file—sent to the repository by all team members every time they are checked into the repository. These files are kept in the Backup folder in the repository. They come in handy if someone accidentally removes or overwrites changes made by other team members. The backup files can be used to recover lost data. However, this also means that the disk space occupied by the repository grows rapidly when members check in their changes, especially if the D2H project file is checked in frequently.</p>
        <p>To conserve the repository disk space, an administrator should delete unneeded backup files from time to time. This can be done using C1D2HTeamAdmin.exe. The administrator can delete backups manually by deleting all or part of the contents of the Backup folder in the repository. Each version number has its own subfolder inside the Backup folder, so you can delete only particular versions, if necessary. If you wish, back up those folders elsewhere before deleting them.</p>
