                <p>When you work in a team project, you can perform any of the following tasks. Options for working with files are available from the Team ribbon in Doc-To-Help, as well as by right-clicking on a file in the Team Authoring window (see <MadCap:xref href="About Team Authoring.htm#TeamAuthoringEnvironment">Team Authoring Environment</MadCap:xref>).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Add File </span>To add a new document or file to the team project, you must first add it to your working copy, then check the new file into the team project. After you check the file in, other team members can check out and edit the new file. See <MadCap:xref href="Adding a New File to the Team Project.htm">Adding a New File to the Team Project</MadCap:xref>.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Check Out Project File </span>In most cases, you do not need to check out the Doc-To-Help project (D2H) file. However, there are some cases when this is necessary. If you need to make the following changes, check the project out, make the changes, and check it back in. See <MadCap:xref href="Checking out the Project File.htm">Checking Out the Project File</MadCap:xref>.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Compare Documents </span>In TFS repositories, you can compare two versions of a document. See <MadCap:xref href="Comparing Documents TFS repositories only.htm">Comparing Documents</MadCap:xref>.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Delete File </span>To delete an existing file from the team project, you must first check out the project. Once you have deleted the file from the team project, it will not be available for editing by any member of the team. See <MadCap:xref href="Deleting a File from the Team Project.htm">Deleting a File from the Team Project</MadCap:xref>.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Edit Document </span>To edit a document for a team authoring project, you first need to check it out. After it is checked out, no one else can edit it until it is checked back in. (If using TFS, you can allow checking out by others, depending upon the lock type.) See <MadCap:xref href="Editing a Document.htm">Editing a Document</MadCap:xref>.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Get Latest Version </span>It is possible to retrieve the latest version of a file (including a project file) from the server. TFS projects have the additional option to retrieve a specific version of a file from the server. Getting the latest version does not check out the file, but synchronizes your working copy with the server. See <MadCap:xref href="Getting the Latest Version of a File.htm">Getting the Latest Version of a File </MadCap:xref>.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">View Document History </span>In TFS repositories, you can view the history of a document. See <MadCap:xref href="Viewing the Document History TFS repositories only.htm">Viewing the Document History</MadCap:xref>.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">View File Properties </span>In TFS repositories, you can view the properties of a document. See <MadCap:xref href="Viewing File Properties TFS repositories only.htm">Viewing File Properties</MadCap:xref>.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Work Offline </span>There are occasions when you may want to take your working project offline. This is convenient if you are planning to edit your documents at home or on a trip. See <MadCap:xref href="Working Offline.htm">Working Offline</MadCap:xref>.</li>
