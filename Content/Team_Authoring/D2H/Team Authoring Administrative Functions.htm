        <p>A special administrative utility is included when Doc-To-Help is installed. This utility, C1D2HTeamAdmin.exe, should be used by the Doc-To-Help administrator to perform certain actions, such as removing backup files, unlocking files from the repository, upgrading a team authoring project, or removing team authoring support from a working copy of a project. See <MadCap:xref href="About Team Authoring.htm">About Team Authoring</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>C1D2HTeamAdmin.exe can be found in <span class="Emphasis">\\Program Files (x86)\MadCap Software\DocToHelp</span>. Double-click on it to open.</p>

                <p>In addition to setting up a team project (see <MadCap:xref href="Setting Up a Team Project.htm">Setting Up a Team Project</MadCap:xref>), following are the primary tasks of an administrator:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Change Repository Settings </span>When a project is first set up for team authoring using the Share Project Wizard, the author sharing the project determines if the number of backup files kept in the repository for each file is limited, and, if so, to how many. The author also determines whether other team members can delete old backup files when they check a newer version of the file into the repository and the limit of backups for that file has been exceeded. These settings can be changed by the administrator using C1D2HTeamAdmin.exe. See <MadCap:xref href="Changing Repository Settings.htm">Changing Repository Settings</MadCap:xref>.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Remove Backup Files </span>To conserve the repository disk space, an administrator should delete unneeded backup files from time to time. See <MadCap:xref href="Removing Backup Files from the Repository.htm">Removing Backup Files from the Repository</MadCap:xref>.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Remove Team Authoring Support </span>You can remove team-authoring support from a local, working copy of a project.  See <MadCap:xref href="Removing Team Authoring Support from a Working Copy.htm">Removing Team Authoring Support from a Working Copy</MadCap:xref>.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Unlock Files in Repository </span>Checking out a file creates a lock in the repository that prevents other team members from checking out the same file. This could cause a problem if an author checks out a file and forgets to (or cannot) check it back in. Then the file remains permanently locked, preventing the other team members from checking it out and modifying it. The administrator can manually remove the lock using C1D2HTeamAdmin.exe.  See <MadCap:xref href="Unlocking Files in the Repository.htm">Unlocking Files in the Repository</MadCap:xref>.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Unlock DHV File </span>In certain circumstances, you may need to unlock a special file, &lt;project_name&gt;.dhv, located in the D2HTeamInfo folder created by Doc-To-Help. See <MadCap:xref href="Unlocking the dhv File.htm">Unlocking the DHV File</MadCap:xref>.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Upgrade Project </span>All users of a team project must have exactly the same version (including build number) of Doc-To-Help installed on their machines. To upgrade the project to a newer version of Doc-To-Help, the administrator must first upgrade the team project in the repository and then each team member can install the newest version of Doc-To-Help. See <MadCap:xref href="Upgrading a Team Authoring Project.htm">Upgrading a Team Authoring Project</MadCap:xref>.</li>
