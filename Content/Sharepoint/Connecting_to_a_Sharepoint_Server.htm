It all depends on how your company or team likes to work. If it is decided that individuals working on SharePoint files should check them out first, follow all three steps below. Otherwise, you can simply perform the middle step to simply open and edit the files.<ol><li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel"><MadCap:keyword term="Microsoft SharePoint:check out" />(Optional) Check Out Files </span>You can check out files from the <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> interface.

When you do this, you are opening the actual file existing on the SharePoint site. If it is a file type not supported in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />, you will be directed to open the file in its default application. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineLive">See <MadCap:xref href="Opening_SharePoint_Files.htm">Opening SharePoint Files</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></li><li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel"><MadCap:keyword term="Microsoft SharePoint:check in" />(Optional) Check In Files </span>When you are finished working on a SharePoint file that you checked out, you can check it back in so that others can edit it. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineLive">See <MadCap:xref href="Checking_In_SharePoint_Files.htm">Checking In SharePoint Files</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></li></ol></li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">(Option #2) Map/Open/Edit/Synchronize Copies of SharePoint Files </span>After you connect to a SharePoint server, thus populating the SharePoint Explorer, you can open and edit any of the files in it. However, keep in mind that when you do this, you are editing the actual files existing on the SharePoint site. But there is an alternative. You have the option of copying any of the SharePoint files to your <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> project. That way you can edit copies of the files locally rather than working directly on the actual files located on the server. Following are the steps for using this method.<ol><li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel"><MadCap:keyword term="Microsoft SharePoint:map files" />Copy and Map Files </span>You can right-click on any files in the SharePoint Explorer and copy them to your <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> project. When you do this, you can map the copied files in your project to the source files on the SharePoint server. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineLive">See <MadCap:xref href="Copying_and_Mapping_Sharepoint_Files.htm">Copying and Mapping SharePoint Files</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText> This is a different process than that of importing files, which you can do elsewhere in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />. Files that are brought into a project using a traditional import process can be connected to the source file, but only in one direction (i.e., files can be updated from the source to the imported file in the project). On the other hand, files that are copied from the SharePoint Explorer can be connected via mappings to the source files in two directions (i.e., files can be updated from the source to the copied file or from the copied file to the source).</li><li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel"><MadCap:keyword term="Microsoft SharePoint:map files" />Manage Mappings </span>If you copy SharePoint files, you should create mappings (connections) between the copies of the files that you bring into your project and the source files on the SharePoint server. You can do this at the point that you copy those files into your project. You can also manage these mappings whenever necessary through the Map Files and Folders dialog. This involves the ability to create, change, or remove mappings. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineLive">See <MadCap:xref href="Managing_Mappings_of_SharePoint_Files.htm">Managing Mappings of SharePoint Files</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></li><li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel"><MadCap:keyword term="Microsoft SharePoint:Edit files" />Open and Edit Files </span>You can open a copy of a SharePoint file from the Content Explorer by simply double-clicking it, just as you would open any other content file in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />. If it is a file type not supported in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />, you will be directed to open the file in its default application. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineLive">See <MadCap:xref href="Opening_SharePoint_Files.htm">Opening SharePoint Files</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></li><li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel"><MadCap:keyword term="Microsoft SharePoint:sychronize files" />Synchronize Files </span>After you map project files to source files located on a SharePoint server, you can synchronize them to ensure that each file contains the same content. This process allows you to import content from SharePoint files, export content from mapped files in the project to SharePoint, or keep the most recently modified content. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineLive">See <MadCap:xref href="Synchronizing_Sharepoint_Files.htm">Synchronizing SharePoint Files and Folders</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></li></ol></li>
