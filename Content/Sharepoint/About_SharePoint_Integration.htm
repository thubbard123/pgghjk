        <p>SharePoint is like a scaled-down version of a source control tool, with the ability to check out and check in files. Many organizations use a source control tool to manage files that are part of products and will be shipped to customers, while using SharePoint mostly for internal files to be shared among colleagues. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineLive">For more information see <a href="http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">www.sharepoint.microsoft.com</a>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

The other steps are optional, depending on how you and your company or team wants to work. You might decide to use the check-in/check-out functionality, or you might decide to use the copy/map/synchronize features.</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="ContributorGuides.ContributorReviewWorkflowGuide">For more details, see the online Help.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
                <ol MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare">
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Connect to SharePoint Server</span>  From the SharePoint Explorer in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />, you can connect to a specific SharePoint server. You can then use that window pane to access the files on that server. See <MadCap:xref href="Connecting_to_a_Sharepoint_Server.htm">Connecting to a SharePoint Server</MadCap:xref>.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel"><MadCap:keyword term="Microsoft SharePoint:Edit files" />(Option #1) Open/Edit the Actual SharePoint Files</span>  If you want to open and edit any of the files existing on the SharePoint server, you can do so with or without checking them out. It all depends on how your company or team likes to work. If it is decided that individuals working on SharePoint files should check them out first, follow all three steps below. Otherwise, you can simply perform the middle step to simply open and edit the files.<ol class="LowerAlpha"><li><span class="SetOffSecondLevel"><MadCap:keyword term="Microsoft SharePoint:check out" />(Optional) Check Out Files </span>You can check out files from the <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> interface. Checking out a file simply means to activate a "flag" on the SharePoint site indicating that you want to access the file and prevent others from editing it and conflicting with your changes (see <MadCap:xref href="Checking_Out_SharePoint_Files.htm">Checking Out SharePoint Files</MadCap:xref>). If necessary, you can also undo any check outs.</li><li><span class="SetOffSecondLevel">Open and Edit Files </span>You can open a file from the SharePoint Explorer by simply double-clicking it. When you do this, you are opening the actual file existing on the SharePoint site. If it is a file type not supported in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />, you will be directed to open the file in its default application. See <MadCap:xref href="Opening_SharePoint_Files.htm">Opening SharePoint Files</MadCap:xref>.</li><li><span class="SetOffSecondLevel"><MadCap:keyword term="Microsoft SharePoint:check in" />(Optional) Check in Files </span>When you are finished working on a SharePoint file that you checked out, you can check it back in so that others can edit it. See <MadCap:xref href="Checking_In_SharePoint_Files.htm">Checking In SharePoint Files</MadCap:xref>.</li></ol></li>

                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel"><MadCap:keyword term="Microsoft SharePoint:sychronize files;Microsoft SharePoint: map files" />(Option #2) Map/Open/Edit/Synchronize Copies of SharePoint Files</span>  After you connect to a SharePoint server, thus populating the SharePoint Explorer, you can open and edit any of the files in it. However, keep in mind that when you do this, you are editing the actual files existing on the SharePoint site. But there is an alternative. You have the option of copying any of the SharePoint files to your <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> project. That way you can edit copies of the files locally rather than working directly on the actual files located on the server. Following are the steps for using this method.<ol class="LowerAlpha"><li><p><span class="SetOffSecondLevel">Copy and Map Files </span>You can right-click on any files in the SharePoint Explorer and copy them to your <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> project. When you do this, you can map the copied files in your project to the source files on the SharePoint server. See <MadCap:xref href="Copying_and_Mapping_Sharepoint_Files.htm">Copying and Mapping SharePoint Files</MadCap:xref>. This is a different process than that of importing files, which you can do elsewhere in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />. Files that are brought into a project using a traditional import process can be connected to the source file, but only in one direction (i.e., files can be updated from the source to the imported file in the project). On the other hand, files that are copied from the SharePoint Explorer can be connected via mappings to the source files in two directions (i.e., files can be updated from the source to the copied file or from the copied file to the source).</p></li><li><span class="SetOffSecondLevel">Manage Mappings </span>If you copy SharePoint files, you should create mappings (connections) between the copies of the files that you bring into your project and the source files on the SharePoint server. You can do this at the point that you copy those files into your project. You can also manage these mappings whenever necessary through the Map Files and Folders dialog. This involves the ability to create, change, or remove mappings. See <MadCap:xref href="Managing_Mappings_of_SharePoint_Files.htm">Managing Mappings of SharePoint Files</MadCap:xref>.</li><li><span class="SetOffSecondLevel">Open and Edit Files </span>You can open a copy of a SharePoint file from the Content Explorer by simply double-clicking it, just as you would open any other content file in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />. If it is a file type not supported in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />, you will be directed to open the file in its default application. See <MadCap:xref href="Opening_SharePoint_Files.htm">Opening SharePoint Files</MadCap:xref>.</li><li><span class="SetOffSecondLevel">Synchronize Files </span>After you map project files to source files located on a SharePoint server, you can synchronize them to ensure that each file contains the same content. This process allows you to import content from SharePoint files, export content from mapped files in the project to SharePoint, or keep the most recently modified content (see <MadCap:xref href="Synchronizing_Sharepoint_Files.htm">Synchronizing SharePoint Files</MadCap:xref>). If you attempt to synchronize files and <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> detects a conflict (i.e., a mapped file has been modified both locally and in its mapped location), a dialog opens so that you can take the appropriate action (see <MadCap:xref href="../External_Resources/Merging_Mapped_Files.htm">Merging Mapped Files</MadCap:xref>).</li></ol></li>
