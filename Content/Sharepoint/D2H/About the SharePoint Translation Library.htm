        <p>Uploading your content to a SharePoint Translation Library provides an easy way to track translations, provide content to translators who do not use Doc-To-Help, and create localized targets.</p>
        <p>A wizard will take you through the steps of uploading your documents to a SharePoint Translation Library. In addition to being uploaded, separate Doc-To-Help projects will be created for each translation language. The workflow for translation projects set in SharePoint will be used for your projects. The project translators do not need to have Doc-To-Help on their machines to translate, and as they work with the documents,&#160; status notification messages are posted in Doc-To-Help so that you know where each document is in the workflow.</p>

                <p>Following are the primary tasks for using the SharePoint Translation Library:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Create a SharePoint Translation Library </span>Before you upload projects from Doc-To-Help to SharePoint, you first need to create a SharePoint Translation library.  See <MadCap:xref href="Creating a SharePoint Translation Library.htm">Creating a SharePoint Translation Library</MadCap:xref>.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Upload Documents </span>After creating a Translation Management Library in SharePoint, you can upload your documents. See <MadCap:xref href="Uploading Documents to a SharePoint Translation Library.htm">Uploading Documents to a SharePoint Translation Library</MadCap:xref>.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Work with a Translation Project </span>After you have uploaded your project to a SharePoint Translation Library, translators can check the documents out of SharePoint and begin translating them. See <MadCap:xref href="Working with a Translation Project.htm">Working with a Translation Project</MadCap:xref>.</li>

                        <li>In Windows, open the <span class="Emphasis">Control Panel&gt;User Accounts and Family Safety&gt;Credential Manager</span>. (This is the path for Windows 7.)</li>
                        <li>Find the SharePoint Server credentials and remove them.</li>
