        <p>Uploading your content to a SharePoint Library allows you to take advantage of SharePoint’s management and workflow features. Doc-To-Help works with SharePoint’s check in/check out features and permissions, so you get a complete source control and version control system.</p>
        <p>A wizard will take you through the steps of uploading your documents to a SharePoint Library. After they are uploaded, they can be checked in and out of the SharePoint Library from Doc-To-Help, using right-click menus. It is not necessary&#160; to open SharePoint to access your documents. </p>
        <p>Doc-To-Help automatically checks for document updates on your machine, and those in the SharePoint Library, and suggests documents that need to be synchronized. You can do this manually by clicking the Synchronize button. You also have the option to merge documents if the local Doc-To-Help copy and the SharePoint Library copy differ.</p>
        <p>You can temporarily turn off synchronization using the Work Offline button.</p>

                <p>Following are the primary tasks for using the SharePoint Library:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Add SharePoint Documents to Project </span>You can add any existing&#160; document stored in a SharePoint Library to your Doc-To-Help projects. The document can remain in its existing library after import for check in/check out, or it can be downloaded with no connection to SharePoint.  See <MadCap:xref href="Adding SharePoint Library Documents to a DocToHelp Project.htm">Adding SharePoint Library Documents to a Doc-To-Help Project        </MadCap:xref>.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Check Documents In and Out </span>You can check documents in and out of the SharePoint Library to work on them. See <MadCap:xref href="Checking documents In and Out of the SharePoint Library.htm">Checking Documents In and Out of the SharePoint Library</MadCap:xref>.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Merge Documents </span>If both versions of a document (the SharePoint Library version and the version on your machine—the local copy) are different, and you trying to save, open, close, or synchronize a single Word document, a dialog will give you the option to overwrite one of the documents, or merge the two documents. See <MadCap:xref href="Merging Word Documents.htm">Merging Word Documents</MadCap:xref>.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Stop Sharing a Document </span>If you no longer wish to share a document with the SharePoint Library, you can stop sharing using the right-click menu. See <MadCap:xref href="Stop Sharing a Document.htm">Stop Sharing a Document
        </MadCap:xref>.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Synchronize Documents </span>Doc-To-Help automatically synchronizes the documents changed in the SharePoint Library with those on your machine. However, you can also synchronize documents manually. See <MadCap:xref href="Synchronizing Documents.htm">Synchronizing Documents
        </MadCap:xref>.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Upload Project Documents to SharePoint </span>You can upload Doc-To-Help documents to a SharePoint Library. See <MadCap:xref href="Uploading Documents to a SharePoint Library.htm">Uploading Documents to a SharePoint Library</MadCap:xref>.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Work Offline </span>You can turn off the synchronization with the SharePoint Library server and work offline. See <MadCap:xref href="Working Offline.htm">Working Offline
        </MadCap:xref>.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #bed230;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">You can edit Word documents—even the source documents in your project—while Doc-To-Help builds a target. If you choose to edit a source document that has been shared to SharePoint, it can only be edited locally and all automatic operations with the SharePoint server are disabled.</p>
